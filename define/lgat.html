      <h2>Large-group awareness training</h2>

      <p>
      Large-group awareness training (LGAT) are seminars and groups that claim to be
      able to transform people's lives by allowing them to reach their potential.
      </p>

      <p>
      Notable groups involved in LGAT are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Leadership Dynamics</li>
        <li>Mind Dynamics</li>
        <li>Lifespring</li>
        <li>Erhard Seminars Training</li>
        <li>The Forum</li>
        <li>Landmark Education</li>
        <li>Benchmark Courses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      A 1989 study concluded that LGATs had very little long-term effect on participants and
      that many of the marketing claims used by these organizations are unsubstantiated.
