      <h2>Bible-based</h2>

      <p>
      Bible-based groups are those that use the Christian Bible as evidence for their
      supernatural and dogmatic claims. They shamelessly reinterpret verses of scripture
      and cherry-pick the parts that are convenient for them. 
      </p>

      <p>
      These groups often view mainstream Christianity with contempt and they try to
      convince their followers that their religion is the only path to God.
      </p>

      <p>Notable bible-based groups are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Jehovah's Witnesses</li>
        <li>The Mormon Church</li>
        <li>Unification Church</li>
        <li>Jonestown</li>
      </ul>
