      <h2>Dianetics</h2>

      <p>Dianetics is a set of pseudo-psychiatric ideas about mental health and treatments for
      mental illnesses. The book is called "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health"
      and was written by L. Ron Hubbard and published in May 1950.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the book, Hubbard introduces concepts called "the reactive mind", "the somatic mind" and
      "the analytical mind". He claims that "auditing" can be used to boost IQ and improve
      mental health.
      </p>

      <p>These ideas have been criticized by medical professionals due to the lack of scientific
      content and outright pseudo-science.
