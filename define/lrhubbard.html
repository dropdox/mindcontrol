      <h2>L. Ron Hubbard</h2>

      <p>
      L. Ron Hubbard (1911-1986) is the creator of <a href="dianetics.html">Dianetics</a> and the founder of the Church of Scientology.
      He was extremely critical of psychiatry, psychology and psychoanalysis and he argued that
      they were dangerous. The solution to mental health problems, he claimed, is Dianetics. 
      </p>

      <p>
      Hubbard was a writer who is known for his science-fiction work but he also wrote in other
      genres including mystery and adventure.  
      </p>

      <p>
      He also had somewhat of a military career in the U.S. Navy. He came back telling stories of
      amazing acts of heroism and fantasical things that happened during his time the Navy.
      These claims were denied by U.S. Navy officials.
      </p>

      <p>
      He acquired a doctorate degree from an unaccredited university and tried to use his credentials
      to push Dianetics onto the public and discredit the field of psychiatry.
