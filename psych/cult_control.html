<h2>Cult Control</h2>

<p>
How cults recruit, indoctrinate and gain psychological control over members.
</p>

<blockquote>
the process of cult and mass therapy indoctrination may involve repeated inductions of trance-like states of consciousness similar to hypnosis. environmental (milieu) control, social manipulation, isolation and the use of prescribed consciousness-altering techniques (e.g. repetitive and/or continuous chanting, meditating, or praying) are some of the methods employed by cults to produce these altered states of awareness. recent studies suggest that memories, emotions and even spiritual experiences can be manipulated while in hypnosis. lack of informed consent and questionable concern for individual needs and wishes makes the use of these hypnotic techniques unethical. being subjected to repeated and prolonged hypnotic inductions can impair the convert's ability to make decisions and evaluate new information; moreover, the convert's altered awareness can "lock in," and become a conditioned personality response pattern. one result can be periodic episodes of unwanted trance experiences ("floating") that occur for months or even years after a cultist exits his/her group.

<blockquote>
  Japanese studies on psychological manipulation, "cult mind control," have been developing in this decade from a social psychological perspective. This paper reviews empirical examinations of the indoctrination process, maintenance and expansion, anti-social activity, and the post-cult psychological distress. From these studies, it was found that many sets of social influences are systematically applied to new recruits during the indoctrination process.  These influences facilitate ongoing control of cult members. The mechanisms of influence and psychological consequences of cult psychological manipulation are discussed.

  Recently, psychologists in Japan have been examining a contemporary social issue—certain social groups recruit new members by means of psychologically manipulative techniques called “mind control.” They then exhort their members to engage in various antisocial behaviors, from deceptive sales solicitation and forcible donation to suicide and murder. We classify such harmful groups as “cults” or even “destructive cults.” Psychologists concerned with this problem must explain why ordinary, even highly educated people devote their lives to such groups, fully aware that many of their activities deviate from social norms, violate the law, and may injure their health. Psychologists are now also involved in the issue of facilitating the recovery of distressed cult members after they leave such groups.

<blockquote>
  Unprecedented escalation of secular and religious cults have necessitated
  further inquiry into more precide conditions under which individuals develop
  vulnerability and become converted by these groups. The present discussion
  focuses on a number of factors which seem to influence individuals' susceptibility
  and recruitment by cults. These variabled include (a) generalized ego-weakness and
  emotional vulnerability, (b) propensities toward dissociative states, (c) tenuous
  deteriorated or nonexistend family relations and support systems, (d) inadequate means of dealing with exigencies of survival, (e) history of severe child abuse or neglect, (f) exposure to idiosyncratic or eccentric family patterns, (g) proclivities toward or abuse of controlled substances, (h) unmanageable debilitating situational stress and crises, and (i) intolerable socioeconomic conditions. Also presented are methods utilized by cults, e.g., intimidation, coercion and indoctrination, for 
  systematically recruiting, initiating and influencing inductees. More careful atttention to these factors might help health care providers, educators, clergy and concerned family and friends determine more precisely individuals at greater risk for recruitment into cults.

<blockquote>
  The contribution to empirical research of a possible predisposition for cult involvement is rarely available on an international scale. The current observations, experiences and statements made to this theme are indeed countless but are also often extremely inconsistent. So it is claimed, for example, that many cult members come from dysfunctional families or that a psychopathological disorder was already existent before joining a cult. In opposition to this include those who hold the opinion that cult members come from completely normal, functional and protective families who clearly have no history of psychopathological illness. The proposed work should be ascertained whether such a disposition to joining a cult actually exists and if so, which factors could be responsible.
  <p>

  All the data of conducted inquiries included in this study were derived from families who consulted the author for advice because one or more of their family members decided to join a cult.
  <p>

  The basis of this inquiry represented a semi-standardised questionnaire of case histories which was sent to the affected families, partners and/or friends before the initial consultation. Hence, the questionnaire was an external assessment in the form of a written examination. It managed to achieve the quantitative and qualitative data of a sample of 110 cult members aged between 12 and 50 years. This is (at least for the Federal Republic of Germany) the largest sample ever conducted in relation to this theme.

  <p>
  The following focal points should be thoroughly examined: 
  The family background and the personality of the cult members, as well as the situational conditions and the psychological state just prior to joining the cult.
  The most significant results are as follows:
  <p>
  ? The majority of persons, who were single before joining the cult, came from either middle-class or upper-middle-class families and were aged between 21 and 25 years. In addition, they were raised with several brothers and sisters in small provinces and rural towns (astonishingly, from the total amount surveyed, only 3 individuals were without siblings). The standard of education was comparatively high. Most of the parents were married.
  <p>
  ? The majority of persons suffered simultaneously from several burdening experiences before joining a cult. Further, most of them experienced a dysfunctional family background and were confronted with difficult life situations (critical life events) immediately prior to joining a cult.
  <p>
  ? Only a small amount of persons indicated a psychopathological disorder.
  <p>
  ? Approximately half of those surveyed were discribed as being altruistic, sensitive and lonely. Only a quarter of those surveyed were found to be naive, unstable, introverted, idealistic and/or denoted a lack of self-awareness.
  <p>
  ? According to slightly more than half of the cult members (after individual statments were made), the decisive factor for joining a cult was the desire for a binding doctrine. Only a small amount regarded self-realisation or discontentment as a motive for joining.
  <p>
  ? Specific differences in gender could be proven. An increasing number of female cult members came from small towns and Protestant families who rarely attended church. These women viewed their family situation as incriminatory and the communication as restrictive. While the women were more dissatisfied with their life circumstances, the male cult members were described as being increasingly introverted. Furthermore, the male members were more interested in the doctrine/ideology of the respective grouping.
  <p>
  ? Further, it succeeded by presenting a profile of 3 cult categories: Christian-Fundamentalist groups, Guru Movements and Psycho-Cult/Esoteric Movements.
  <p>

  In the following, the profile of these 3 cult categories shall be presented in more detail. Those who joined a Christian-Fundamentalistic cult, were mainly aged between 21 and 25 years. A majority reported to have attended church on a regular basis and were reared in families who showed a lack of communicative competence. Further, they often regarded a sense of community, a binding doctrine and the search for a meaningful life as being significant reasons for joining.

  <p>
  Those who joined the Guru Movements, were aged between 16 and 20 years. A majority of these members were men and first-born children who mainly attended secondary school without having completed their matriculation. Regular church attendance took place. Fewer persons were reported to have experienced incriminatory family situations whilst more claimed to have experienced competent communication within the family. They were considered as being neither altruistic nor depressive, but rather introverted. Further, they claimed to be searching more for a binding doctrine and less for a meaningful life.
  <p>

  The members of the alleged Psycho-Cults and Esoteric Movements entered these groups at a notably older age, between 26 and 30 years. These movements were predominately made up of female members who rarely attended church and came from split families. Further, they experienced increasingly burdening family situations and suffered from problems relating to work or school immediately before joining a cult. They were not regarded as being introverted but were described as having egoistic personalities. In addition, they considered that neither the search for community nor the need for a binding doctrine were relevant means for joining a cult.

<blockquote>
  Interviewed 18 Ss (aged 20–51 yrs) for their descriptions of and emotional reactions to an introductory training program of a mass marathon psychology organization ("educational" group workshops using a schedule of didactic and experimental events during which participants must comply with the demands of the trainer). A working model of the recruitment/indoctrination process was prepared and evaluated. Data strongly support all aspects of the working model: The training consisted of an iatrogenic dynamic in which a premeditated attack on the self of the S resulted in a severe narcissistic crisis and identity impasse that abated only by converting to the organization.

  A study was designed to assess the psychological effects of participation in an intervention that has been classified as a large group awareness training (LGAT). One hundred and thirty-five participants in the Forum (the successor to the est training and at present the most widespread LGAT) and 73 comparable peer-nominated control Ss completed detailed questionnaires approximately 4–6 weeks pre- and 4–6 weeks posttraining. Participants and nominees also completed similar measures approximately 1½ years later. Both Forum participants and nominees were men and women who were predominantly White, well educated, and of relatively high socioeconomic status. Forum outcome was assessed on a broad array of outcome dimensions (perceived control, life satisfaction, daily coping, social functioning, positive and negative affect, self-esteem, physical health, and symptomatology), using multivariate techniques. The short-term outcome analyses revealed that only perceived control was affected by Forum participation, and no long-term treatment effects were observed. Results suggest that claims about far-reaching positive or negative psychological effects of participation in LGATs such as the Forum may be exaggerated.
