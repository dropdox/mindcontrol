<h2>Cult Control</h2>

<p>
How cults recruit, indoctrinate and gain psychological control over members.
</p>

<blockquote>
the process of cult and mass therapy indoctrination may involve repeated inductions of trance-like states of consciousness similar to hypnosis. environmental (milieu) control, social manipulation, isolation and the use of prescribed consciousness-altering techniques (e.g. repetitive and/or continuous chanting, meditating, or praying) are some of the methods employed by cults to produce these altered states of awareness. recent studies suggest that memories, emotions and even spiritual experiences can be manipulated while in hypnosis. lack of informed consent and questionable concern for individual needs and wishes makes the use of these hypnotic techniques unethical. being subjected to repeated and prolonged hypnotic inductions can impair the convert's ability to make decisions and evaluate new information; moreover, the convert's altered awareness can "lock in," and become a conditioned personality response pattern. one result can be periodic episodes of unwanted trance experiences ("floating") that occur for months or even years after a cultist exits his/her group.

<blockquote>
  Japanese studies on psychological manipulation, "cult mind control," have been developing in this decade from a social psychological perspective. This paper reviews empirical examinations of the indoctrination process, maintenance and expansion, anti-social activity, and the post-cult psychological distress. From these studies, it was found that many sets of social influences are systematically applied to new recruits during the indoctrination process.  These influences facilitate ongoing control of cult members. The mechanisms of influence and psychological consequences of cult psychological manipulation are discussed.

  Recently, psychologists in Japan have been examining a contemporary social issue—certain social groups recruit new members by means of psychologically manipulative techniques called “mind control.” They then exhort their members to engage in various antisocial behaviors, from deceptive sales solicitation and forcible donation to suicide and murder. We classify such harmful groups as “cults” or even “destructive cults.” Psychologists concerned with this problem must explain why ordinary, even highly educated people devote their lives to such groups, fully aware that many of their activities deviate from social norms, violate the law, and may injure their health. Psychologists are now also involved in the issue of facilitating the recovery of distressed cult members after they leave such groups.

<blockquote>
  Unprecedented escalation of secular and religious cults have necessitated
  further inquiry into more precide conditions under which individuals develop
  vulnerability and become converted by these groups. The present discussion
  focuses on a number of factors which seem to influence individuals' susceptibility
  and recruitment by cults. These variabled include (a) generalized ego-weakness and
  emotional vulnerability, (b) propensities toward dissociative states, (c) tenuous
  deteriorated or nonexistend family relations and support systems, (d) inadequate means of dealing with exigencies of survival, (e) history of severe child abuse or neglect, (f) exposure to idiosyncratic or eccentric family patterns, (g) proclivities toward or abuse of controlled substances, (h) unmanageable debilitating situational stress and crises, and (i) intolerable socioeconomic conditions. Also presented are methods utilized by cults, e.g., intimidation, coercion and indoctrination, for 
  systematically recruiting, initiating and influencing inductees. More careful atttention to these factors might help health care providers, educators, clergy and concerned family and friends determine more precisely individuals at greater risk for recruitment into cults.
