<h2>Hazing and Group Initiation</h2>

<p>
Demanding or humiliating tasks used in group initiation causes new members to be more loyal to the group.
</p>

<blockquote>
  An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that persons who undergo an unpleasant initiation to become members of a group increase their liking for the group; that is, they find the group more attractive than do persons who become members without going through a severe initiation. This hypothesis was derived from Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance." 3 conditions were employed: reading of "embarrassing material" before a group, mildly embarrassing material to be read, no reading. "The results clearly verified the hypothesis

  Initiation practices likely support group functioning by promoting group-relevant skills
  and attitudes, reinforcing status hierarchies, and stimulating cognitive, behavioral, and
  affective forms of social dependency. In field tests of these propositions, 269 undergraduates
  from same-gender organizations rated their initiation experiences. As predicted,
  athletes reported relatively more physical challenge and pain, whereas members
  of Greek-letter organizations reported more social deviance and embarrassment. Hierarchy
  was positively associated with initiations featuring social deviance but unexpectedly
  negatively related to physically and psychologically harsh initiations. Harsh
  treatment and fun independently predicted group identity. Laboratory experiments on
  male (n / 74) and female (n / 37) undergraduates found that discomforting inductions
  increased social dependence on group opinion and, for women, increased additional
  forms of dependence (proximity to induction agents and negative mood when left
  alone). The results across studies suggested that hazing’s task masters are 3: schooling
  skills and attitudes, conveying hierarchy, and promoting social dependency.

  Initiation rites are a common feature of many cultures. Classic laboratory studies conducted in the West have shown that the more severe the group admission process (the initiation), the stronger the liking of the group joined. Cognitive Dissonance Theory is typically offered as the theoretical explanation offered for this effect. New group members are though to exaggerate their liking of their new group as a way of avoiding feelings of dissonance. However, this explanation overlooks the role of culture in group initiation rites across the world. In many world cultures, initiation rites have functions and consequences beyond those typically explored in existing psychological literature. Amongst many African tribes, initiation rites have a strong educational element and initiates are typically taught about important tribal customs/ practices. This paper explores the cultural functions of initiation rites amongst a variety of African tribes, arguing that initiation rites serve as important conveyors of cultural knowledge and as a way of preserving cultural knowledge from generation to generation.

  Undergoing an admission process (an initiation) can induce exaggerated feelings about a group, but there is little research about the role of rewards. This study replicated Aronson and Mills’ (1959) experiment. Seventy participants underwent either a severe initiation or a mild initiation. After the initiation, about half the sample received an extrinsic reward for merely completing the task. The remaining half did not receive an extrinsic reward. This was to vary the amount of dissonance. Initiation severity and reward condition had significant, noncrossing interactions. A reward led to higher group identity than no reward, supporting Levine and Moreland's (1994) group socialization model. A severe initiation did not lead to more group identity than a mild initiation; therefore, Aronson and Mills’ findings were not replicated. Interestingly, a mild initiation followed by a reward led to more group identity than a severe initiation followed by a reward. Another unexpected finding was that the extrinsic reward made no difference to group identity if the initiation was severe. Effects on ratings of the discussion were nonsignificant. Future research needs to establish how new group members ponder the severity of the admission process during the cost–benefit calculation preceding their identification with a group.

In this paper I explore the various meanings of the term ‘initiation’, in the context of certain traditions and practices at Universities, which can cause personal physical or psychological harm if not contained and regulated. The paper focuses on a case study of the practice of ‘serenading’ at a small residential University. It draws on an eclectic assortment of methodological approaches in order to get closer to the ‘truth’ about this social practice, and to assess whether it should be viewed as a form of initiation, or as something which is intrinsically positive. These methodological approaches include a deeply personal account, rooted in narrative research, and the results of two large-scale surveys. Results accord with social identity theory (Tajfel &amp; Turner, 1979), in terms of which group identity tends to override personal identity in certain contexts where belonging and fitting in is important, and with cognitive dissonance theory (Aronson &amp; Mills, 1959; Keating et al., 2005), in terms of which people tend to attribute a greater value to something they had to put a lot of effort into doing or achieving (as opposed to its actual worth). These demanding and humiliating tasks lead new initiates to increase the subjective value of the group, and this contributes to group loyalty and solidarity. Those students who had ‘survived’ the tradition were keen to impose it on new students, and argued that it is good for them. But selected personal accounts and the survey results suggest that the practice was not entirely free of coercion, and that there is some danger in allowing certain traditions to reproduce ‘dominant discourses’ which inevitably construct certain students (the ones who do not wish to participate) in deficit terms.
