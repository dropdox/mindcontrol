<h2>Large Group Awareness Training</h2>

<p>
Seminars which claim to promote self-awareness and change people's lives.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Interviewed 18 Ss (aged 20–51 yrs) for their descriptions of and emotional reactions to an introductory training program of a mass marathon psychology organization ("educational" group workshops using a schedule of didactic and experimental events during which participants must comply with the demands of the trainer). A working model of the recruitment/indoctrination process was prepared and evaluated. Data strongly support all aspects of the working model: The training consisted of an iatrogenic dynamic in which a premeditated attack on the self of the S resulted in a severe narcissistic crisis and identity impasse that abated only by converting to the organization.

<blockquote>
  A study was designed to assess the psychological effects of participation in an intervention that has been classified as a large group awareness training (LGAT). One hundred and thirty-five participants in the Forum (the successor to the est training and at present the most widespread LGAT) and 73 comparable peer-nominated control Ss completed detailed questionnaires approximately 4–6 weeks pre- and 4–6 weeks posttraining. Participants and nominees also completed similar measures approximately 1½ years later. Both Forum participants and nominees were men and women who were predominantly White, well educated, and of relatively high socioeconomic status. Forum outcome was assessed on a broad array of outcome dimensions (perceived control, life satisfaction, daily coping, social functioning, positive and negative affect, self-esteem, physical health, and symptomatology), using multivariate techniques. The short-term outcome analyses revealed that only perceived control was affected by Forum participation, and no long-term treatment effects were observed. Results suggest that claims about far-reaching positive or negative psychological effects of participation in LGATs such as the Forum may be exaggerated.
