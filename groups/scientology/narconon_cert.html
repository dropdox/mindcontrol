      <h2>
Certification of Narconon Chilocco
Is Not Acceptable
For The Following Reasons:</h2>

The Narconon program is unacceptable as a legitimate treatment
program for many reasons:
<p>
Because the source of the program, L. Ron Hubbard was
unqualified; his program has never received the necessary
independent scientific study to verify it's effectiveness and claims of
success; and the program deviously inculcates in its patients the basic
tenants of the "religion" of Scientology as part of the treatment
program itself.
<p>
Narconon has terminated more units in the US than it currently has
in operation in spite of claims of worldwide acceptance, astounding
cure rates and enormous patient counts.
<p>
The Narconon organization is an inseparable part of a classic
destructive cult that strongly exhibits the characteristics of mind
control, and it is so vigorously opposed to legitimate mental health
care professionals that it considers them to be criminals.
<p>

A.L. Ron Hubbard Unqualified
L. Ron Hubbard, author and source of the Narconon Drug Treatment Program
was not qualified in any discipline even remotely related to drug treatment or
rehabilitation.
<p>

1. Educational Background - embellished beyond imagination Documented
details available in several books:
"A Piece of Blue Sky"
By Jon Atack
Carol Publishing Group, 120 Enterprise Ave., Secaucus, NJ 07094
<p>

"Bare-Faced MeSsiah"
By Russell Miller
Henry Holt & Company, 115 West 18th St. New York, NY 10011
<p>

"Messiah or Madman?
By Bent Corydon
Lyle Stuart, 120 Enterprise Avenue, Secaucus, N.J. 07094
<p>

2. Military Background - same
<p>

3. Professional Career - fiction writer
<p>


B. Narconon Program Unproven
The Narconon Drug Treatment Program has never been proven to be safe and
successful by independent research.
<p>

1. In operation over 20 years with no acceptable independent research.
<p>

2. Source of the program, L. Ron Hubbard during his over 30 years of
writing, never produced one paper that met the criteria of acceptable
scientific study.
<p>

3. Claims of cure rates as high as 86% can not be accurately substantiated
and in fact, the criteria on which those claims are based varies from time to
time and from spokesman to spokesman within the program's management.
<p>

4. Patient count figures are wildly exaggerated, often stated as in the
hundred's of thousands with no verifiable documentation.
<p>

5. Medically and scientifically trained people in the field have examined
the documents upon which the Narconon program is based and find them
inaccurate, misleading, and possibly dangerous to the health of patients.
<p>

a. Of the document, Dr. Everett R. Rhoades, M.D., Assistant
Surgeon General of the Indian Health Service, Public Health Service,
Department of Health and Human Services said, "...the 'Purification
Rundown' concept cannot be considered medically sound."
<p>

b. Said Dr. William B. Svoboda, M.D., (Pediatric and Adolescent
Neurology and Epileptology, Wichita, Ks.) of the Purification
Rundown document: "... Hubbard's theories in general are just that...
theories without controlled proof. He flings facts around wildly in
excess... to drown the readers in facts in order to convince them that
he knows..."
<p>

c. Dr. Mark Palmer, M.D., Internal Medicine, Ponca City, says: "I
think it is fair to say that the Purification Rundown is without
merit," and further, "In general, it appears to me that the overall
program being advocated by Narconon is nothing more than a
poorly disguised program for obtaining recruits into the Church of
Scientology..."
<p>

d. According to Dr. Bruce Roe, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry and
Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, Norman: "Overall the
program proposed by Mr. Hubbard is pure unadulterated 'cowpies'.
It is filled with some scientific truth, but mainly is illogical and the
conclusions drawn by Mr. Hubbard are without any basis in scientific
fact..."
<p>

e. Of Narconon's progenitor, Dr. Louis Jolyon West, M.D.,
Professor of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles, says:
Scientology is an insidious and dangerous cult. Its founder, L. Ron
Hubbard, was a science-fiction writer whose career as a mental
healer was founded on extravagant lies and deception."
<p>

f. Dr. David Hogg, M.D., Toronto, Canada: "In summary, Hubbard
is a very ignorant man. He consistently demonstrates a complete and
at times dangerous lack of knowledge concerning biochemistry,
physics, and medicine. His theories are based on fallacies and lies;
there is no scientific data to support any of them... His program not
only fails to deliver what it promises but may actually be detrimental
to the health of those taking it."
<p>

g. The Tennant evaluation of Narconon New Life in Los Angeles,
issued by Dr. Forest S. Tennant, Jr., M.D., P.H. to the California
State Health Department in 1974 said among many other things: "In
the case of Narconon New Life, there was adequate indication that
public money is being used for purposes other than drug
rehabilitation... Our evaluation indicates such an inseparable
programmatic and theoretical relationship between Narconon and the
Church of Scientology that specifically religious practices are
commonly used in the treatment of clients within the Narconon New
Life program. Such practices include E-Meter auditing by ministers
of the Church of Scientology and the use of educational material and
organizational theory adopted from Church of Scientology writings
by L. Ron Hubbard..."
<p>

h. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, as a member of
the National Coalition Against Health Fraud, has criticized the
"Purification Program" or "Hubbard Method" which is central to the
Narconon program. Specifically, he opposed it's promotion in the
book "Diet for a Poisoned Planet" by David Steinman, published by
Harmony Books, which carried the suggestion by James Marcus (a
known Scientology spokesman) of the EPA that people should
undertake the program at a Scientology clinic in California known as
HealthMed. Scientology, of course, was not mentioned in the book,
and Dr. Marcus leaves the impression that the program is approved
by the EPA. Mr. Marcus has been involved in previous such
implications in the past, one involving his recommendation that
firemen in Shreeveport LA be treated at HealthMed after being
exposed to a PCB fire. After paying over $100,000.00, the city of
Shreeveport hired independent experts to evaluate the program, and
consequently terminated it as useless.
<p>

i. Dr. Robert E. Geary, D.D.S., past member 648 Mental Health
Board of Medina County, OH, who underwent the Purification
program himself says, "As a health care practitioner that has
participated in their so-called Purification rundown, which is the
basis for Narconon's treatment program, I would say it is bunk." and
further, "Following my wife's purification program, she began
having difficulty sleeping, having hallucinations and other bizarre
symptoms which the Scientologists told her were normal. She
eventually required hospitalization... I consider their treatment to be
unscientific and dangerous."
<p>

j. An independent (non-Scientology related) study of the Purification
Rundown was proposed in 1985 by Dr. Joseph Miceli, Associate
Professor of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Children's Hospital of
Michigan. Dr. Miceli's proposal suggested that the method might
actually have some value in reducing toxins (PBBs and PCBs) from
the body - but not for any of the reasons suggested by its author, L.
Ron Hubbard.
However, the Human Subject Review Committee at Wayne State
University refused to allow the study to proceed because it was
deemed unfit for human expirmentation, according to Dr. Doug
Spathelf, research director at Central Michigan University, and Dr.
Danial Graf, research director at Wayne State University.
<p>

6. Narconon is unable to produce a single non-Scientology expert who will
support their program with scientific or medical evidence. The "experts"
they often trot out always turn out to be deeply steeped in Scientology. Dr.
Chamberlain is a Ph.D., retired, and an OT VIII Scientologist. So was his
sidekick Dr. Dean. Dr. Megan Shields is a longtime Scientologist. All of
the documents and articles produced in defense of Narconon's methods
inevitably refer to "research" done by the Foundation for Advancements in
Science and Education, which is an organization formed by Scientologists
"to advance the efficacy of and use of the methods of L. Ron Hubbard."
<p>

7. The Narconon drug treatment program is not listed in any of the
nationally recognized drug treatment reference books commonly used by
physicians or other professionals.
<p>

8. Narconon has never been accredited by any independent national
medical or scientific accreditation firm in the United States. The Narconon
treatment program has never been certified by any state government that
we know of. Some of it's facilities have received a perfunctory State Health
Department license for reasonably good housekeeping, but this is
concerned primarily with the facility housing the program, and not the
program itself.
<p>

9. Success or cure in the Narconon program is considered to have
happened when the patient subjectively believes that his body is free of
drug residue, with no other form of prior or post testing required. The
patient must immediately "attest" to his cure, and if no glowing testimonial
is forthcoming, the program must be continued, or repeated.
<p>

a. The program often uses an E-Meter to determine if the patient's
feeling that he is cured is "True" or not. An E-Meter is a religious
artifact of the Church of Scientology, and not a scientifically or
medically approved device. Its use requires the services of a
Scientology minister.
<p>

b. Further promotion of the Narconon program is through the use
of these so-called "Success Stories" subjectively given by the patient
immediately upon completion of the program. Testimonial and
anecdotal evidence may be useful in postulating a theory, but does
not constitute scientifically acceptable proof.
<p>

c. Former Narconon staff member Jerry Whitfield was statistician at
the E1 Paso, Tx., Narconon where he produced a "cure rate" of over
80% based on 6 responses to 20 questionairs mailed to previous
patients.
<p>

10. The criteria for admission to Narconon as a patient appears to be
questionable. In most documented cases, the only criteria were the verbal
admission of the patient that he was a drug abuser, and approval by the
admissions director after an interview with the patient to determine his
"attitude" towards the program. Considering that the organization teaches
that all humans are "aberated" by ingested toxins of one kind or another
and all require the Purification Rundown and related rituals in order to
make progress ( or "case gain"), exactly what constitutes a "drug abuser" is
questionable to begin with. Narconon has also historically been found to
lack adequate follow-up procedures, and any actual recoveries can
probably be accounted for as:
<p>

a. Recoveries which would have occurred without their treatment,
or by treatment in any other facility, because of the sincere desire of
the individual himself.
<p>

b. Temporary Placebo-Effect recoveries
<p>

c. Religious conversion to Scientology with its severe strictures
against drugs of all kinds, medicine, and professional mental health
care.
<p>

11. There are physiological and psychological effects of the Narconon
Purification Program that should be considered and evaluated before the
program is accepted as scientifically accurate, safe, and effective.
Specifically:
<p>

a. Symptomatic physiological-psychological stress:
<p>
1. Excessive acid intake may cause gastric distress
<p>
aa. Acetic acid in Cal-Mag formula
<p>
bb. Gram quantities of ascorbic acid
<p>
cc. Gram quantities of nicotinic acid
<p>
2. Nicotinic acid reaction may be stressful
<p>
aa. Skin irritation
<p>
bb. Itching and burning
<p>
3. Unmonitored and uncontrolled exercise may be excessive
for age and physical condition
aa. Tachycardia 
<br />
  bb. Breathing difficulties
  <p>
  4. Sauna heat may cause heat stress
<br />
  aa. Body temperature rise, unmonitored temperature
<br />
  bb. Peripheral vaso-dilation
<br />
  cc. Hypotension, unmonitored blood pressure
<br />
  dd. Inadequate fluid replacement, unmonitored weight
  <p>
  5. Nicotinic acid reaction may exacerbate:
<br />
  aa. peripheral vaso-dilation
<br />
  bb. Hypotension
<br />
  cc. Tachycardia
<br />

  b. Asymptomatic physiological stress:
<br />
  1. Excessive acid intake may cause gastric damage
<br />
  aa. Acetic acid in Cal-Mag formula
<br />
  bb. Gram Quantities of Ascorbic acid
<br />
  cc. Gram quantities of nicotinic acid
<br />
  2. Excessive acid intake may cause blood acid-base imbalance
<br />
  aa. Acetic acid in Cal-Mag formula
<br />
  bb. Gram Quantities of Ascorbic acid
<br />
  cc. Gram quantities of nicotinic acid
<br />
  3. Copious sweating may cause electrolyte disturbances
<br />
  aa. Unmonitored and uncontrolled fluid loss
  dehydration
  bb. Electrolyte loss through sweating
<br />
  cc. Unmonitored and uncontrolled Cal-Mag ingestion
<br />
  dd. Unmonitored and uncontrolled NA and K ingestion
<br />

  4. Excessive and unmonitored trace mineral intake
<br />
  aa. Excessive iron
<br />
  bb. Excessive copper
<br />

  c. Psychological effects:
<br />
  1. Bodily discomfort and pains
<br />
  2. Torpor, stupor, lethargy
<br />
  3. Difficulty concentrating, light headedness, mental drifting
<br />
  4. "Re-experiencing" (imagining or hallucinating) earlier drug
  episodes from both this life and/or past lives
<br />

  C. Incorporates "Religion" As Part Of Treatment
  The Narconon Program constitutes the involuntary inculcation of Scientology
  religious beliefs and practices in the patient as a part of the treatment program
  itself and therefore certification of this program would constitute the
  enfranchisement of a religion by the state, which is illegal.
  <p>

  1. Examination of the Scientology Religious Progress Chart known as the
  Bridge To Total Freedom shows the following religious steps taken by
  every Scientologist who enters the "church":
  <p>

  a. The Happiness Rundown
<br />
  b. The Purification Rundown
<br />
  c. The TR Course
<br />
  d. The Drug Rundown
<br />
  e. The Objectives program
  <p>

  2. Examination of the Narconon Technical Line-Up Chart shows the
  following treatment steps:
  <p>

  a. The Happiness Rundown
<br />
  b. The Purification Rundown
<br />
  c. The TR Course
<br />
  d. The Drug Rundown
<br />
  e. The Objectives program

  <p>
  3. Examination of the content of each of the above five steps shows that
  both are identical; there is no essential difference between the entry levels
  of Church of Scientology "religious" training and processing and the
  Narconon treatment program.

  <p>
  4. The titles of the steps of the Narconon treatment program may
  sometimes be different, or groups of steps packaged under more "civilian"
  names to make the program appear different from that given in the
  "church" of Scientology, but the content has to remain essentially the same.
  To do otherwise would be "squirreling" with the "tech", which was written
  by L. Ron Hubbard, is considered sacred scripture, and if changed in any
  significant way, would no longer be "standard."
  <p>

  5. A patient at Narconon, by simply believing he is taking a drug treatment
  program, is unwittingly "doing" Scientology. Not as voluntary, extra
  curricular activity, but as mandatory, essential, parts of the treatment itself.
  While other drug treatment programs are often associated with or
  sponsored by religions, none requires that religious practices be
  performed, knowingly or unknowingly, by their patients as part of the
  treatment program itself.
  <p>

  6. The Narconon program, when not under scrutiny, commonly utilizes
  the E-Meter during the delivery of it's programs. The E-Meter is a
  religious artifact of the Church of Scientology. An E-Meter operator, or
  Auditor, is a minister of the Church of Scientoloy, by their own definition.
  Delivery of at least two of the steps of the Narconon program require the
  services of an Auditor.
  <p>

  7. The document upon which the core of the Narconon program is based is
  HCOB 6 Feb. 1978RA. It was written by L. Ron Hubbard, Founder, and
  was approved by the Boards of Directors of the Churches of Scientology.
  The final paragraph reads:
  <p>

  "The Purification Rundown has as its sole purpose the handling of
  the restimulative effects of drugs and toxic residuals on a spiritual
  being. The Purification Rundown is a spiritual activity
  based on and administered according to the doctrine and
  practices of the religion of Scientology as set forth in the
  writings of L. Ron Hubbard and adopted by the Church. No part of
  the rundown is intended as the diagnosis, prescription for, or
  treatment of any bodily or physical condition or ill. The Church is
  not responsible for the handling of any bodily or physical condition
  or ill, it being the responsibility of the individual to seek the
  competent medical advice and treatment of his docto'r in such
  matters." (emphasis added)
  <p>

  8. Former Narconon staff member Jerry Whitfield was statistician at the
  E1 Paso Narconon. One of the statistics he was to determine each week was
  "How many new Scientologists have we made this week?"
  <p>

  9. The trademarks and copyrights required by Narconon in order to
  operate its program are owned by the Association For Better Living and
 Education, which is an organization listed on the Church of Scientology
  "Org Board", or organization chart.
  <p>

  a. The Association For Better Living and Education was created in
  October 1988 by Scientology. Scientologist Sherman D. Lenski
  signed the incorporating document, and the organization's purpose,
  to oversee Narconon's operation, is explained in "The Command
  Channels of Scientology". Prior to this, Narconon's operations were
  the function of the Social Coordination Bureau (or B-l) of the
  infamous Scientology Guardian's Office which was disbanded when
  11 of their top people, including Henning Heldt and Hubbard's wife
  Mary Sue, were sent to prison for breaking in and burglarizing
  government offices.
  <p>

  b. Narconon was incorporated on May 16, 1970 by Scientology Rev.
  Arthur J. Maren, Scientology Guardian's Officer Henning Heldt, and
  Scientologist William C. Benitez.
  <p>

  c. Narconon pays ABLE for the use of materials, trademarks, and
  copyrights. Without those materials, trademarks, and copyrights,
  Narconon would cease to exist. It can not change even one word of
  the program or process without violating those agreements.
  <p>

  D. High Rate of Program Terminations
  More Narconon Units around the United States have been closed down in the past
  20 years than are currently in operation.
  <p>

  1. Narconon programs have been shut down, or public funding for them
  cut off in many areas of the country over the past two decades:
  <p>

  a. Los Angeles - 1974 report recommended that State funding not be
  continued due to many flawed aspects of the program including the
  programmatic and theoretical inseparability of the treatment
  program and the religious practices of the "church" of Scientology.
  <p>

  b. Palo-Alto - ? to 1977 city evaluation reported many deficiencies,
  and a low level of performance. Program was terminated.
  <p>

  c. Denver - ? to 1980 Narconon program at Lookout Mountain
  School for Boys terminated. Reason unknown.
  <p>

  d. Connecticut- 9 to 1976
  terminated.
  <p>

  State Prison Narconon programs
  <p>

  e. Delaware - 1972 to 1976 - Prison Narconon programs terminated
  when a State Crime Agency study showed Narconon's claims of
  success were False and it's connection with Scientology raised
  questions about the propriety of the program.
  <p>

  f. Menard County, Illinois - 1970 to 1972 - Short lived Narconon
  program no longer in existence in 1972.
  <p>

  g. Ionia, Mi. 1976 to 1980 - Narconon programs terminated at
  three Michigan prison facilities following the revelation that the
  program was identical to the "religious" practices of the "church" of
  Scientology, and a prison study concluded that Narconon graduates
  "do not do as well as our (prison) population in general."
  <p>

  h. St. Cloud, Minn. - 1978 - 1981. Program terminated after prison
  officials uncovered deep connections between the program and the
  "church" of Scientology. Program operated on state and federal
  funding as well as private donations. One who was conned by the
  project was Minn. Senator Rudy Boschwitz, who has confirmed that
  he has relayed his Narconon experiences to Oklahoma Senators
  David Boren and Don Nickles.
  <p>

  i. E1 Paso, Tx. (no dates was in operation in 1974). Former
  Scientology Sea Org member and Bureau of Indian Affairs employee
  George Baca of Albequerque, New Mexico, was responsible for
  referring Indian patients to this unit. He reports that results were so
  dismal that he not only quit his job with the BIA, but also left
  Scientology. This was the unit where Jerry Whitfield was a staff
  member taking a weekly headcount of new Scientology conversions.
  The unit is not on the current list of active Narconon facilities, but
  the termination date is unknown.
  <p>

  j. Many others, most of which appear to have been merely telephone
  numbers or referral points, have existed from time to time over the
  years, but now seem to be no longer in operation. Baton Rouge, La.,
  is one such example.
  <p>

  2. Existing Narconon units in the United States:
  <p>

  a. A unit near Boston, Mass., which is an outpatient organization run
  by the Church of Scientology.
  <p>

  b. An outpatient unit in Golden, Co., run by the Church of
  Scientology, and a small unit in Bradenton, FI., which opened just
  this year.
  <p>

  c. The "mother" unit, a 24 bed facility in Los Angeles.
  <p>

  d. Several foreign units exist in France, Italy, Sweden, and Spain,
  some of the governments of which are investigating the programs
  for fraud and tax evasion.
  <p>

    3. The question becomes: If Narconon has the world-wide acceptance they
    claim, and if they truly have a cure rate approaching their claims of 86%,
    why are these Narconon units no longer in operation around the country7
    Are there no more addicts to cure in Minnesota, Michigan, Connecticut,
    Delaware, Illinois, and other places around the country
  <p>

    E. Evidence of Mind Control
    There is evidence that Narconon, which utilizes the identical "L. Ron Hubbard
    Technology" as the Church of Scientology, exhibits the same four identifiable
    attributes of Mind Control that are practiced by Scientology and other Mind
    Control cults.
  <p>

    1. Control of Behavior is instilled early through many of the processes of
    the Training Routines Course, and others, as well as by the structural
    design of the organization itself, through Tone charts, Ethics Conditions,
    and the like. Total, unquestioning obedience is the desired result of these
    early processes.
  <p>

    2. Control of Thought is instilled primarily through the establishment of a
    new vocabulary in which words are created with automatic thought
    controlling definitions, and common words are assigned new meanings.
    Control of thought is also maintained by the need for acceptance within the
    group, and the restriction of contact with outsiders or other free thinkers.
    Thought Control is also accomplished through the "auditing" process, the
    technical details of which are explained in the Anderson Report to the
    Australian Government under the topic of Hypnosis.
  <p>

    3. Control of Emotion. A person's emotions are powerful persuaders to
    keep a patient or recruit in line with the goals of the organization. The
    Narconon system is perfect, and so any failure to succeed is the fault of the
    patient. Only the founder and source is perfect, and so anyone else is
    obviously imperfect, and must work harder to become like the leader, or
    fail and face the wrath of expulsion and the impossibility of life without the
    perfect system. Narconon patients, like Scientology recruits, are afraid they
    aren't living up to the perfection expected of them, and are yet afraid to
    leave it.
  <p>


    4. Control of Information - Read L. Ron Hubbard's works. And not much
    else. After all, why bother reading anything else, when Hubbard has all the
      answers.
      <p>

      F. Evidence of Cult Characteristics
      Narconon, like its progenitor Scientology, also contains all of the characteristics
      of a classic destructive cult.
      <p>

      1. Authoritarian, single source - L. Ron Hubbard
      <p>

      2. Absolute doctrine or belief system - "Standard Tech"
      <p>

      3. Bi-polar Value system - Theta and Entheta
      <p>

      4. Hidden agenda, Inner Circle, Protected body of confidential knowledge
      - "Confidential" upper OT levels
      <p>

      5. Belief that the End justifies the Means, - "Total Freedom" is more
      important than anything it might take to get there, no matter how illegal or
      unethical the action might be, including "Shore Stories", "Acceptable
      Truths", "Change Histories", and other deceptive practices.
      <p>

      6. Belief that the Group's goals are more important than the Individual -
      "Clearing the Planet for Ron" supersedes family, friends, self.
      <p>

      7. Strict obedience to superiors and the modeling after the leader - The
      establishment of "Ethics" conditions, the Tone chart, Rehibilitation Project
      Force, and other forms of internal justice and punishment attest to this
      trait. And the whole goal of Scientology is for its members to "follow" Ron
      across the Bridge to Total Freedom.
      <p>

      8. Offers happiness through good performance in accomplishing the goals
      of the group - "Upstats and Downstats", Production quotas and goals.
      <p>

      9. Member manipulation through fear and guilt - Fear of being excluded
      from the few who will reach "Total Freedom"; guilt for not accomplishing
      ever increasing production quotas.
      <p>

      10. Causing grandiose swings between emotional "highs" and "lows" - as
      evidenced by the temporary "Euphoria" upon completion of auditing
      sessions, and the depression that soon follows creating the desire for
      further auditing to ragain the euphoric state.
      <p>

      11. An elitist mentality - "Scientologists are the top 10% of the top 10% of
      the human race." - LRH. Only Scientologists have the Bridge to Total
      Freedom. Only Scientologists can Clear the Planet.
      <p>

      12. Changing the person's relationship with his past, present, and future.
      Auditing and the hypnotic state it induces warps an individual's perception
      of his own life, and creates a state in which the person actually believes in
      past lives. See Anderson Report, Hypnosis and Auditing.
      <p>

      13. Offering no acceptable way to leave the organization - There is no
      acceptable way to leave the organization without having completed the
      "Bridge". One carmot just quit, as is possible in the Lion's Club or Jaycees.
      One who quits becomes an SP, or Suppressive Person and earns the wrath
      of the group for doing so. There are no lukewarm members.
      <p>

      G. Attitude Toward Legitimate Mental Health Professionals
      The treatment of alcohol and substance abusers is a function of the Mental Health
      Department of the State of Oklahoma, which is responsible for certifying such
      programs as safe and effective for the citizens of the state. As such, the attitude,
      policy, and behavior of Narconon and its progenitor Scientology, toward
      orthodox mental health care and related professions should be noted.
      <p>

      1. Of mental health professionals, L. Ron Hubbard writes:
      <p>

      a. "Psychs... have been on the track a long time and are the sole
      cause of decline in this universe .... The universe only seems that way
      to a being because such loathsome psychotics make it seem so. They
      destroyed every great civilization to date and are hard at work on
      this one .... "(HCOB 26 Aug 1982)
      <p>

      b. "So look well at psychs and anti-religious campaignerS. They are
      speaking from their own blackened souls, and they speak from
      terror... Thus the psychs with their rantings and electric shocks wear
      their own brand clearly marked on them by their own conduct in
      life. Recognize them for what they are; psychotic criminals - and
      handle them accordingly. (HCOB 6 May 1982)
      <p>

      c. Psychologists and psychiatrists'... "treatments" make the criminals
      more stupid. The stupid commit more crimes... The answer to crime
      is raising IQ. But only the Scientologist can do that. (HCOB 26 April
      1982)
      <p>

      d. "... psychology and psychiatry... do not achieve ANY good
      results. On the contrary they are destructive beyond belief. They
      make crackpots, sexpots and vegetables when they do not outright
      kill." (HCOB 29 Nov. 1981 )
      <p>

      e. "... the majority of psychiatrists maim and kill their patients and
      by record, in all history, have only worsened mental conditions ...."
      (HCOB 15 Sept. 1981 )
      <p>

      f. "The instigators, patrons and supporters of these two subjects
      (psychiatry and psychology) classify fully and demonstrably as
      criminals." (HCOB 29 July 1980)
      <p>

      g. "Doctors are too often careless and incompetent, psychiatrists are
      simply outright murderers." (HCOB 6 Dec. 1976)
      <p>

      h. "Our error was in failing to take over total control of all mental
      healing in the West. Well, we'll do that too." (LRH ED 55 INT 29
      Nov. 1968)
      <p>

      2. This attitude, and subsequent policy towards legitimate mental health
      care stems directly from the author of the Narconon program, who, among
      many other bizarre pronouncements and teachings, said...
      <p>

      a. he had visited Heaven twice, and found it rather shabby and
      unkept the second time. (HCOB 11 May AD 13) (AD means "after
      Dianetics")
      <p>

      b. that all of man's problems are caused by the hundreds or
      thousands of dead men's souls (Body Thetans or BTs) that possess his
      body, and that only his teachings can remove these "Body Thetans"
      and thereby relieve man's problems, cure his diseases, and give him
      "Total Freedom". (OT III material and higher)
      <p>

      3. It is the "Standard Tech" designed by this man, L. Ron Hubbard,
      that the Oklahoma Board of Mental Health is being asked to certify
      as legitimate drug treatment on November 8th. Short of bribery,
      extortion, or stupidity, they cannot, in good faith, do so.
      <p>

      G. Evidence of Religious or Racial Bigotry Does Not Exist
      As can be seen by reading the above material, those opposing the certification of
      Narconon exhibit no religious or racial bigotry whatsoever, in spite of the
      wailing about descrimination that spews forth from Scientology...
      <p>

      1. On the contrary, those opposing certification do so on the basis of the
      preservation of religious freedom, contending that the state should not
      enfranchise the establishment of religion as part of a treatment program.
      Them is no opposition whatsoever to the open establishment of the Church
      of Scientology or the practice of Scientology rituals or beliefs as a part of
      their religion. The objection is only to the deceptive inculcation of those
      practices and beliefs into a treatment program we are led to believe is
      secular and independent of the church of Scientology.
      <p>

      2. There is no evidence whatsoever of racial bigotry exhibited by those
      who object to certification of the program. We object to certification
      because it would constitute fraud upon all those vulnerable people who
      might be lured into the program because it was "state certified", no matter
      whose land it was located on, or what the race, creed, color, handicap, or
      national origin of the people operating it or being "treated" by it.

      <h3>NARCONON/SCIENTOLOGY COMPARISON</h3>

      <p>
      The Narconon treatment program is nothing more than the initial steps one
      must take when one is recruited into the "Church" of Scientology. They are
      identical in nature, form, substance, and purpose.

      <p>
      Progress Charts:
      Scientology: The "Church" of Scientology publishes a chart of "religious"
      progress known as the Bridge To Total Freedom, consisting of many steps. Each
      step up the Bridge is composed of various types of "training" and "processing"
      one must purchase and complete before going to the next step. In addition, there
      are other courses that can be taken at different points during ones travel "up the
      Bridge." Some courses have to be taken or re-taken several times during the trip
      "up the Bridge" if so determined by one's Case Supervisor (read - Scientology
      minister, E-Meter operator, Auditor).

      <p>
      Narconon: Scientology publishes a chart known as The Narconon Technical
      Line-UP consisting of several steps. Each step up the Narconon Technical Line-
      Up can also be found on the Bridge To Total Freedom religious progress chart of
      the "Church" of Scientology.

      <p>
      Recruitment:
      The Bridge: People are enticed into Scientology through free introductory
      services including Introductory Lectures, Personality Tests, and Introductory
      Courses.
      Narconon: People are routed into Narconon through Seminars, Lectures,
      Conferences, L. Ron Hubbard Books, Public Relations media promotion,
      advertising, word of mouth, Field Scientology Missions, or referral from social
      boards, parents, counsellors, drug rehab programs, government agencies, etc.
      If one is on drugs at the point of recruitment, one is allowed to "come down"
      through a drug free or "cold turkey" process. If one is currently not physically
      addicted to drugs, one is given a Drug Education/Orientation Lecture concerning
      the Narconon program to follow.

      <p>
      Step One:
      The Bridge: Step one on the Bridge Chart is called the Purification
      Rundown. On the training side, it contains the Hubbard Professional TR
      (Training Routines) Course which presents Scientology's full theory and
      application of the Communication Cycle, the end result of which is said to be the
      Ability to Confront in (auditing) Session and Life and to Control Communication.
      On the processing side, the Purification Rundown level contains the
      Purification program itself, during which "Biochemical Factors" are audited (a
      Scientology "confessional" process of Abreaction therapy applied by an "Auditor"
      or minister of the "Church" of Scientology, usually done with the aid of an E-
      Meter, an electronic "religious" artifact similar to a galvanometer.) It also
      includes sauna baths and exercises, as well as special vitamin and nutritional
      therapy. The end result is said to be freedom from restimulative effects of drug
      residuals and other toxins.

      <p>
      Narconon: Step one on the Narconon Technical Line-Up is the Hard TRs (0-
      9) Course, which is said to assist the person to come off drugs on his own volition
      and improve his ability to confront; to give him an understanding of the basics of
      communication and teach him to apply these basics so that he can communicate
      with others effectively.
      These TRs are are identical to those given as training to individuals on the
      Purification Rundown level on the Bridge.
      The next item on the Narconon Technical Line Up is the Purification program
      itself, which is "designed to clean out and purify one's system and free the
      individual from the restimulative effects of drug residuals and other toxins. It
      consists of auditing, sauna baths, exercises, special vitamin and nutritional
      therapy.
      <p>

      Step Two:
      The Bridge: Level two on the Bridge is called Objectives. On the training
      side, one learns Scientology "Study Tech" resulting in a person who understands
      and applies fully the "Tech of Study."
      On the processing side, the Objectives Course is presented where one
      undergoes auditing on "Objective Processes" which requires the services of a
      Class I or above Auditor (Scientology Minister and E-Meter operator, also
      known as a Case Supervisor -1) and is said to result in giving the person the
      ability to be "in present time and able to control and put order into the
      environment."
      Narconon: Next on the Narconon Technical Line-Up is "Objectives", which
      is called a series of processes that can help bring the person out of past incidents
      and into Present Time with the ability to control and put order into the
      environment. The Objectives program "includes a Narconon C/S-1 (read: Case
      Supervisor-l, or Class I Auditor, or E-Meter operator, or Scientology Minister
      -- all are the same thing)
      <p>

      Step Three:
      The Bridge: Level three of the Bridge is called the Scientology Drug
      Rundown. On the training side, one will find Scientology Academy Level 0 which
      teaches about "listen style" auditing, memory and communication, and is said to
      leave one with the ability to audit others in lower levels.
      On the processing side, the Scientology Drug Rundown must be completed,
      which consists of auditing "rehabilitation and recall processes addressing drugs."
      This auditing must be done by a Class III or above Auditor (E-Meter operator, or
      minister of the "Church" of Scientology, or Case Supervisor ~ all the same) It is
      said to result in the individual being released from the harmful effects of drugs,
      medicine or alcohol.
      Narconon: Next on the Narconon Technical Line-Up is The (Scientology)
      Drug Rundown, which is a series of counselling actions (read auditing) that can
      release an individual from the harmful effects of drugs, medicine or alcohol.
      This level also requires the services of a Class III Auditor
      <p>

      Step Four:
      The Bridge: One of the courses that can be taken at any point on the Bridge,
      or as often as the Case Supervisor deems necessary is an auditing process known
      as "The Way To Happiness Rundown." It is based on the booklet "The Way To
      Happiness" by L. Ron Hubbard. Any auditing process, by definition, requires the
      services of a minister of the "Church" of Scientology, and the use of an E-Meter.
      Narconon: Assuming that no "Repair Actions" are needed, the final step on
      the Narconon Technical Line Up is The Way To Happiness Rundown, which
      consists of counselling (read auditing) which is said to help put one on the way to
      happiness.
      <p>

      What's Next?
      The Bridge: From here the budding Scientologist continues up the Bridge,
      through ARC (Affinity, Reality, Communications) Straightwire, Grade 0, I, II,
      III, IV, NED (New Era Dianetics), Clear, Sunshine Rundown, Solo Auditor
      Course part I, OT (Operating Thetan) Preps, Solo Auditor Course part II, New
      OT I, OT H, OT III, New OT IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, etc to whenever one runs out
      of money or they quit releasing new levels. The highest level on the chart is New
      OT XV, which is not yet released, covers materials said to be confidential, and
      gives one a "confidential" ability.
      Narconon: From here, according to the Narconon Technical Line-Up, the
      budding Scientologist takes the "route to the nearest Org (Scientology
      Organization) for further services if individual so desires." See above paragraph.

      Documentation:
      Copies of "The Bridge to Total Freedom" and "The Narconon Technical Line-
      Up" charts are available on request. Documentation verifying and expanding
      upon all of the training courses and auditing processes included in the Narconon
      program or the levels of Scientology are also available upon request.
      <p>

      Conclusion:
      Narconon is a recruiting tool for Scientology. A person cannot submit to the
      Narconon program without knowingly or unknowingly becoming subject to
      Scientology dogma and beliefs.
      Narconon portrays itself as a private drug treatment program in order to
      fraudulently benefit from insurance coverage payments, state and federal
      funding, and other programs designed to assist in solving the drug problem,
      while it is in fact processing new recruits for membership in a mind control cult
	that masquerades as a religion.
