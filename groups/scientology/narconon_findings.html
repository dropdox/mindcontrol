      <h2>Findings of Fact regarding the Narconon-Chilocco Application
        For Certification</h2>
      <p>
      By The Board of Mental Health, State of Oklahoma 
	13 December 1991
        <p>

	Applicant has filed an application with the proper fees
	attached thereto for certification as a drug and treatment
	facility proposing to use a drug free non-medical
	detoxification modality.

      <p>
	The applicant requests certification for services to a 75
	bed residential drug and alcohol center.

      <p>
	The application and supporting documents have been reviewed
	under applicable law and departmental rules and regulations.

      <p>
	In considering the application for certification the Board
	has carefully considered the evidence presented at the
	hearings of October 18, 1991 and December 13, 1991 on the
	application for certification of Narconon International,
	including the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits
	presented and received in evidence.

      <p>
	The Board considered the credibility, demeanor, bias, motive
	and interest of all witnesses in reaching these findings of
	fact.

      <p>
	The proposed site of the program is located on federal land
	belonging to five tribes and operated by the Chilocco
	Development Authority.

      <p>
	A long-term lease between Applicant and the Chilocco
	Development Authority is in effect.

      <p>
	The Development authority and the Applicant have entered
	into a long-term lease agreement wherein the Applicant agrees
	to comply with all the state and federal law including but
	not limited to certification by the Department of Mental
	Health and Substance Abuse Services.

      <p>
	In reviewing the application and determining the merits of
	the application the Board on the October 18, 1991 and
	December 13, 1991 hearings heard evidence and considered the
	issues of safety and effectiveness of the treatment modality
	utilized by the Applicant.

        <p>
	Most drugs of abuse are removed from the body by
	detoxification and excretion through the liver, kidneys, and
	the lungs. Although minute quantities of some drugs may be
	found in sweat the amount represents a small fraction of drug
	elimination.

        <p>
	The Narconon drug treatment modality treats all drug
	addictions the same. No scientific evidence was produced to
	show that all drug addictions are properly treated in the
	same manner.

        <p>
	The terms "patient," "student" and "client" are used
	interchangeably in these Findings.

        <p>
	The Narconon Program exposes its patients to the risk of
	delayed withdrawal phenomena such as seizures, delirium
	and/or hallucinations.

        <p>
	The Board has not considered any evidence of the beliefs or
	opinions of any witness on matters of religion in making its
	findings of fact. To the extent there may be some affiliation
	between Narconon and any religion such affiliation has been
	totally disregarded by the Board. The Board has not made its
	decision on certification based upon any consideration of
	religion or religious affiliation.

        <p>
	The Board concludes that the Applicant, Narconon
	International, has the burden of proving that its program
	meets all requirements for certification and specifically the
	burden of proving its program is both safe and effective.
	Narconon has not sustained its burden of proving its program
	is either safe or effective. However, regardless of wb~ether
	Narconon International has the burden of proof the Board
	concludes there is substantial credible evidence, as found by
	the Board, that the Narconon Program is unsafe and
	ineffective.

        <p>
	The Narconon program requires its patients to sweat up to
	five hours per day, seven days a week, for approximately
	thirty days. The rationale, according to Narconon for the
	sweat-out is to rid the body of fat-stored drugs and
	chemicals through sweat. However, there is no scientific
	basis for the technique. Most drugs of abuse are removed from
	the body by detoxification and excretion through the liver,
	kidneys and (in some instances) through the lungs. Although
	minute quantities of some drugs may be found in sweat, the
	amount represents such a small fraction of drug elimination
	that no matter how much an individual sweated through
	exercise or saunas, the clearance of most drugs of abuse
	would not be significantly increased.

        <p>
	The Narconon program includes the administration of high
	doses of vitamins and minerals to the Narconon patient as
	part of their treatment. The use of high amounts of vitamins
	and minerals in the amounts described administered by
	Narconon can be potentially dangerous to the patients of
	Narconon according to the more credible medical evidence.

        <p>
	The relationship between drug abuse and psychiatric
	disorders is well established. Most drug abusers who enter
	residential drug treatment facilities have high levels of
	anxiety, depression, hostility or apathy. Further, a chemical
	dependency disorder may co-exist with - or be secondary to -
	a specific psychiatric illness, such as schizophrenia or
	major depression, which should be treated by established
	psychiatric procedures. The Narconon program presents a
	potential risk to the patients of the Narconon program that
	delayed withdrawal phenomena such as seizures, delirium or
	hallucination that are occasionally seen several days after
	cessation of drugs such as benzodiazepines may be
	misinterpreted by Narconon's non-medical staff as the effect
	of mobilizing the drug from fat during the sauna sweat-out
	procedure period. There is also a potential risk that the
	reported re-experience of the abused drugs' effect during the
	sauna sweat-out program may be the result of misinterpreted
	symptoms of hyperthermia or electrolyte imbalance since vital
	signs and serum electrolyte levels have not been consistently
	monitored during the sweat-out procedures or when a smudent
	is reporting the phenomena.
        <p>

	The progress notes for the patients at Narconon do not
	consistently evidence that vital signs are recorded every six
	hours in the detoxification process; nor do the progress
	notes record fluid intake for detoxification clients.
        <p>

	Discharge summaries of patients at Narconon were not
	routinely completed within fifteen days of the patient's
	discharge.
        <p>

	The clinical records of patients at Narconon do not
	consistently reflect the recording of vital signs every six
	hours for clients as required under non-medical
	detoxification standards of the Department.
        <p>

	There is credible evidence by way of witness testimony and
	review of Narconon charts which reflect that there were
	patients who had psychiatric problems who were taken off of
	their previously prescribed psychiatric medication who did
	not do well and subsequently developed psychiatric problems.
	This evidence indicates a lack of safety and effectiveness in
	connection with the program.
	Clients of Narconon suffering from psychiatric illness, when
	taken off their prescribed medications, did poorly in the
	Narconon program and were placed in a segregated facility
	called Hdestem". This practice endangers the safety, health
	and /or the physical and mental well being of Narconon's
	clients.
        <p>

	Narconon's program lacks any acceptable degree of quality
	control of the sauna temperatures and treatment. Such a lack
	of control endangers the safety, health and/or the physical
	or mental well being of its clients.
        <p>

	Narconon hires former students to work at Narconon -
	Chilocco immediately upon graduation and the former students
	work directly with the present students. While former
	patients of drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinics can be
	employed in such clinics after graduation, the former
	patient's recovery from his addiction should be established
	with more passage of time to ensure sobriety and to avoid
	putting patients in contact with addicts who are not fully
	recovered. This practice could negatively impact the safety
	and effectiveness of the program.
        <p>

	Narconon does not maintain a sufficient level of follow-up
	of its students after graduation, which impacts the
	effectiveness of the program allowing for relapses and lack
	of recovery.
        <p>

	During an on-site visit in November 1991 a student was found
	with a potentially dangerous low level of potassium which
	could lead to cramps, (muscular, skeletal problems) and
	cardiac arrhythmia.
        <p>

	The vast majority of time spent in the Narconon treatment
	plan and course work does not in any way relate to or involve
	education about drug and alcohol abuse treatment, issues,
	and/ or addiction. The Narconon treatment plan thus has
	deficiencies which render it ineffective. The Narconon
	treatment plan is general in nature, applies categorically to
	all students and is not individualized. The treatment plan
	also lacks measurable individualized objectives which the
	students should seek to achieve in the program. For instance,
	the treatment plan sets a patient's objective as follows: "To
	have a clear mind." This objective is essentially
	meaningless. In order for a bonafide drug treatment plan to
	be effective it is essential to have individualized measured
	objectives which Narconon's treatment plan lacks.

	Part of the Narconon treatment program involves touch
	assists between patients. Touch assists involve massages
	between patients in rooms by themselves. Narconon has both
	male and female patients who are involved in the drug and
	alcohol rehabilitation program. This practice of touch
	assists could likely lead to improper sexual contact between
	drug addicts or alcoholics in the process of recovery. An
	accepted standard in such programs is for the patients to
	keep their hands to themselves. The practice of touch assists
	between male and female patients who are recovering drug
	addicts or alcoholics in private rooms renders the program
	unsafe in this respect.
        <p>

	The discharge planning is not adequate and commences only
	very shortly prior to discharge. This lack of discharge
	planning renders Narconon's program ineffective.
        <p>

	Narconon clients are counseled by Narconon staff that it is
	acceptable for the client to drink alcohol after being
	discharged from the Narconon program and if the client is
	incapable of being able to drink alcohol, then this fact
	evidences the client's need for further treatment. Such
	counseling endangers the client's safety, health and/or the
	physical or mental well being, and is not in accord with
	acceptable drug and alcohol counseling and treatment.
        <p>

	Narconon employes staff inadequately educated and trained in
	the care and treatment of drug and alcohol abuse clients.
	Such a practice endangers the safety, health and/or the
	physical or mental well being of the clients of Narconon.
        <p>

	Narconon permits clients under treatment for drug and
	alcohol abuse to handle and provide medications to fellow
	Narconon clients, to supervise the sauna treatment of fellow
	Narconon clients, and to supervise Narconon clients with
	psychiatric disorders. Such practices endanger the client's
	health and safety and are not in accord with acceptable drug
	and alcohol treatment.
        <p>

	There is substantial medical literature which indicates that
	sauna therapy may pose significant health risks to
	intravenous heroine addicts, which is likely to be treated at
	Narconon, because such drug use may impair normal
	physiological response and problems associated with high
	temperature saunas which could be detected.
        <p>

	The Narconon Program includes running to stimulate
	circulation followed by prescribed periods in a sauna for up
	to 5 hours at extremely high temperatures (i.e. 135ø to 200ø
	F) and as such endangers the safety, health and/or the
	physical or mental well being of its clients. Such a
	procedure exposes the client to the health hazards of
	dehydration and heat injury. This sauna regime also creates a
	risk of hyperthermia and electrolyte imbalance.
        <p>

	Narconon restricts access by Narconon clients to their
	personal physicians, family, attorneys, clergy and others by
	not permitting communications except at limited and
	designated hours. such a practice may endanger the physical
	or mental well being of Narconon's clients.
        <p>

	The Narconon program fails to provide adequate follow-up and
	treatment for Narconon clients demonstrating abnormal lab
	tests and other medical problems. Such failures endanger the
	safety, health and/or the physical or mental well being of
	the Narconon clients and is not in accord with acceptable
	drug and alcohol care and treatment.
        <p>

	There was no evidence that the Narconon staff inventoried
	and verified the medications brought on to the campus by
	Narconon clients. such a failure endangers the safety, health
	and/or the physical or mental well being of Narconon's
	clients.
        <p>

	The Board recognizes that Narconon has in the past few weeks
	adopted many new policies. The evidence did not disclose
	adherence to many if not all of these policies. There was no
	measurable and identifiable compliance by Narconon to its
	newly adopted policies in the areas of taking and recordation
	of vital signs, drug and alcohol instructions to clients,
	handling of medications, withdrawal and discharge procedures,
	lab testing, procedures for emergency medical supplies and
	others.
        <p>

	Narconon clients are routinely administered clonidine.
	Narconon fails to provide adequate supervision for clients
	prescribed this medication given this drug's risks and
	potential for adverse consequences. Such failure to
	adequately supervise endangers the safety, health and/or the
	physical or mental well being of the Narconon clients.
        <p>

	The vast majority of Narconon's course materials in its drug
	and alcohol abuse program are not designed to educate and/or
	treat clients in the area of drug and alcohol abuse. In
	addition, there was only evidence of occasional lectures to
	Narconon clients in areas of drug and alcohol abuse. As such,
	Narconon's program lacks sufficient instruction and education
	in the area of drug and alcohol abuse.
        <p>

	There is no credible scientific evidence that the Narconon
	program is effective in the treatment of chemical dependency.
        <p>

	There is no credible scientific evidence that exercise
	speeds up the detoxification process.
        <p>

	Large doses of niacin are administered to patients during
	the Narconon program to rid the body of radiation. There is
	no credible scientific evidence that niacin in any way gets
	radiation out of the patient's body. Rather, the more
	credible medical evidence supports the existence of potential
	medical risks to persons receiving high doses of niacin.
        <p>

	There is no credible evidence establishing the safety of the
	Narconon program to its patients.
        <p>

	There is no credible evidence establishing the effectiveness
	of the Narconon program to its patients.
        <p>


	Conclusions Of Law
        <p>

	Any finding of fact which should be included in the
	conclusion of law such matters are included hereby by
	reference.
        <p>

	In order for the Application to be granted by the Board it
	must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the
	program is safe and effective for the non-medical residential
	treatment of alcohol and drug abuse.
        <p>

	Th purpose of Mental health law in the State of Oklahoma is
	to provide humane care and treatment of persons who require
	treatment for drugs or alcohol abuse. Residents of the State
	of Oklahoma are entitled to medical care and treatment in
	accordance with the highest standards accepted in medical
	1-102.
        <p>

	The Narconon Chilocco program does not conform to the
	principles of traditional chemical dependency treatment. The
	Board's conclusion that the Narconon Chilocco program is non-
	traditional does not form the basis, in any respect, for the
	Board's decision on the Narconon application for
	certification.
        <p>

	No scientifically well-controlled studies were found that
	documented the safety of the Narconon program. There are
	potential dangers from the use of non-medical staff who may
	be unable to interpret the possibility of seizures,
	delirious, cardiac arrythmia, or hallucinations that are
	phenomena associated with the cessation of drugs. There is
	also a potential risk of the reported reexperience of the
	abused drug effect during the sauna sweat out program may be
	the result of misinterpreted symptoms of hyperthermia or
	electrolyte imbalance. Moreover, the multiple findings of
	fact heretofore entered by the Board establish that
	Narconon's program is not safe.
        <p>

	Drug treatment program offered by Narconon Chilocco is an
	experimental treatment and not proven safe or effective and
	is not in accord with the highest standards accepted in
	medical practice as required by statute.
        <p>

	No scientifically well-controlled independent, long-term
	outcome studies were found that directly and clearly
	establish the effectiveness of the Narconon program for the
	treatment of chemical dependency and the more credible
	evidence establishes Narconon's program is not effective. The
	Board determines that the Narconon Program is not effective
	in the treatment of chemical dependency.
        <p>

	The Board concludes that the program offered by Narconon
	Chilocco is not medically safe.
        <p>

	The Board has reviewed the proposed findings of fact and
	conclusions of law submitted by the Department and Narconon.
	Any proposed finding of fact and/or conclusion of law
	inconsistent with those entered by the Board is denied.
        <p>

	Certification is denied.

	The Narconon
        <p>

	Drug Treatment Program
        <p>

	1. According to "The Narconon Technical Line-Up", a Narconon publication, the
	Narconon drug treatment program consists of several steps: DetoxificationANithdrawal,
	Drug Education/Orientation Lecture, Hard Trs (0-9) Course, Purification Program,
	Objectives, The Drug Rundown, and The Way To Happiness Rundown.
        <p>

	2. The Narconon program was explained by Mr. Leroy Bridges of the State Mental
	Health Department as "standard drug treatment and counseling, with the addition
	of sauna, for which we have 'no feel"'.
        <p>

	3. The following pages explain in a little more detail each step of the Narconon
	program. We ask that you read them over to determine for yourself it they are "standard
	drug treatment and counseling"
        <p>

	4. Please refer to: The Narconon Technical Line-Up, the Bridge To Total Freedom, and
	the Narconon course materials package.
        <p>


	Detoxification/Withdrawal
        <p>

	Drug Education/Orientation Lecture
        <p>

	1. Detoxification/Withdrawal - this appears to be the "standard" part. It reportedly
	consists of cold turkey withdrawal, with considerable personal attention while a person
	is undergoing the stress of withdrawal. For persons medically approved for such
	withdrawal, we have no objections or complaints about this part of the program.
        <p>

	2. Drug Education/Orientation Lecture - Once a person is "down", the rest of the
	program begins with this lecture. On it's surface we find nothing objectionable with a
	lecture on the evils of drugs. The lecture is supposed to also provide full orientation to
	the rest of the Narconon Program.
        <p>

	3. The above two steps are the only steps in the Narconon Program that do not also
	appear on "The Bridge To Total Freedom." The Bridge is the chart of religious progress of
	the Church of Scientology.
        <p>

	Hard TRs
        <p>

	1. Hard TRs (0-9) Course - Training Routines based on Hubbard Communications
	Bulletin of 11 June 1967, Reissued 12 May 1972. (Copy enclosed) The TR Course is
	listed on the first level of the Scientology Bridge To Total Freedom, under the heading of
	"Course"
        <p>

	2. Hard TRs consists of several repetitive drills. Professional Psychologists (names on
	request) familiar with the drills, as well as many former Scientologists, Narconon
	volunteer workers from the Church of Scientology, and Narconon patients with whom we
	have spoken say the drills are "numbing" or "hypnotic", due to the length and constant
	repitition employed during the drills.
        <p>

	3. TRs are required first steps "up the Bridge" into Scientology. They are also required
	in the Narconon program. "Hard" TR's and TR's are essentially the same, the only
	difference is in their application. For instance, TR-0 requires the patient to stare at the
	counselor, while Hard TR-0 requires that the patient also not blink during the period.
        <p>

	4. The TRs are found in the Narconon course book 1, entitled "Therapeutic TR Course;
	and again repeated entirely and exactly in the Narconon course book 4a entitled
	"Communication and  Perception Course."
        <p>


	Exhibit 3
        <p>

	Purification Program
        <p>

	1. Purification Program - A procedure based on Hubbard Communications Office
	Bulletin of 6 February 1978RA, Revised 16 March 1978, Re-Revised 4 December
	1979. (Copy enclosed) The Purification Rundown is listed on the first level of the
	Scientology Bridge To Total Freedom, under the heading of "PC Grade".
        <p>

	2. The Purification Program is the "exercise, sauna, vitamin, and nutrition" part of
	Narconon's treatment program. The document outlining the program says "The
	Purification rundown is a spiritual activity based on and administered
	according to the doctrine and practices of the religion of Scientology..."
        <p>

	This process "correctly belongs to the field of spiritual and religious healing, not in
	the field of medicine..." according to an article in "Scientology Today" (c Jan 1989).
        <p>

	This reasoning, in fact, was the basis of Scientology's defense against charges of
	practicing medicine without a license in Italy.
        <p>

	How, we wonder, can it be construed as religious practice in one place, and secular
	treatment in another?
        <p>

	3. The Purification Rundown appears to be replete with faulty logic, half truths, total
	absurdities, and miraculous statements for which no supporting data are available.
        <p>

	It has been reviewed by Dr. Hogg, M.D., of Ontario, Canada, Dr. Bruce Roe, Professor of
	Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oklahoma, and by Dr. Mark Palmer,
	M.D., of Ponca City, Oklahoma. The opinions of Dr Roe and Dr. Palmer are included, and
	speak for themselves. Opinions were rendered on this material by several other
	Professors at the Universy of Oklahoma on the KOCO-TV special report.
        <p>

	The only attempt at independent (non-Scientology) research on the Purification
	Rundown that we have been able to uncover was proposed by Dr. Joseph Miceli, Associate
	Professor of Pediatrics and Pharmacology at Children's Hospital of Michigan in June of
	1985. The Miceli research proposal suggested that the process might indeed be of some
	benefit in removing toxins (PBBs and PCBs) from the human system, but not for any of
	the reasons proposed by it's originator, Mr. L. Ron Hubbard,
        <p>

	The Miceli study was turned down by the Human Subject Review Committee as
	unacceptable for use on human subjects, according to Dr. Doug Spathelf, Research
	Director of Michigan Central University, and Dr. Danial Graf, Research Director and
	Chairman of the Human Subject Review Committee of Wayne State University. The
	research project, if approved, would have been a joint venture of Central Michigan,
	Wayne State, and Children's Hospital of Michigan.
        <p>

	Yet this is the program the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health is being asked to
	certify as approved for use in the State of Oklahoma.
        <p>

	Objectives

        <p>
	1. Has consisted of a number of different Scientology processes over the years. A list of
	the processes which Narconon currently delivers under the rubric "Objectives" is not
	readily available, but almost certainly includes many of those described in the enclosed
	copy of a portion of HCOB 14 Nov. 1987 "Expanded Grade 1 Process Checklist,"
	according to former members.
        <p>

	2. "Objectives" is found on the "Bridge To Total Freedom" religious progress chart
	under the heading of "PC Grade" as the second step up the "Bridge". It requires a "Class I
	or above Auditor". An Auditor is an E-meter operator, who must be, by definition, a
	minister in the Church of Scientology.
        <p>

	3. "Objectives" training is found in the Narconon course book 4b entitled
	Communication and  Perception Course.
        <p>

	Exhibit 5
        <p>

	Drug Rundown
        <p>

	1. Data not available on the content of this step of the program.
        <p>

	2. The "Drug Rundown" is found on the "Bridge To Total Freedom" religious progress
	chart under the heading of "PC Grade" as the third step up the "Bridge". It requires a
	"Class III or above Auditor". An Auditor is an E-meter operator, who must be a minister
	in the Church of Scientology.
        <p>

	3. Former patients at Narconon-Chilocco have confirmed that the Drug Rundown is not
	given at the Chilocco location, but that patients are encouraged to "go to Los Angeles" to
	receive that portion of the program following completion of the rest of the course at
	Chilocco. There is no course material for the Drug Rundown in the Narconon package of
	materials sold to Narconon patients at Chilocco.
        <p>


	Exhibit 6
        <p>

	Happiness Rundown
        <p>

	1. Auditing (religious practice involving E-meter and minister of the Church of
	Scientology) based on the booklet, "The Way To Happiness" by L. Ron Hubbard. It is
	described as "moral pastoral counseling".
        <p>

	2. The Happiness Rundown is a program which can be run "as recommended by the case
	supervisor" anytime during ones ascent up the "Bridge To Total Freedom", and probably
	as often as is deemed necessary. Description of the Happiness Rundown is located on the
	Bridge religious progress chart among many other offerings above the Free Introductory
	services line, but below the first level of the Bridge. (look under Purification Rundown
	on the greatly reduced chart previously mailed.
        <p>

	3. "The Way To Happiness" booklet is provided to all Narconon students.
        <p>

	4. Almost half of he Narconon course material contains precepts of the religion of
	Scientology regarding their view of acceptable behavior, morals, morays, and ethics.
	These are found in Narconon course books 5 thru 7 entitled "Ups & Downs in Life
	Course", Personal Values and Integrity Course", and "Changing Conditions in Life
	Course."
        <p>

	Most of this material is innocuous common sense. But the courses also subtly introduce
	Scientology's unique stereotypes of Social and Anti-Social people; Suppressive Persons;
	Potential Trouble Sources; and Disconnection, as defined and utilized in the religion of
	Scientology.
        <p>

	The material also explains morality and ethical behaviour in Scientology's religious
	terms. ie: Survival along the Eight Dynamics and Confession of Overts (Sins) and
	Withholds (Sins of omission), This material suggests that the End justifies the Means;
	that whatever causes "the greatest good for the greatest number of dynamics" is moral
	and ethical behaviour.

	Conclusion
        <p>

	1. Although they were promised to several individuals who have asked for them,
	Narconon has not delivered any "treatment protocols". The material reviewed herein has
	been provided to us by former members of the Church of Scientology and former
	Narconon patients who have taken the course. They tell us there is simply no difference
	between the Narconon program and the Scientology religious program, except that
	insurance will usually pay if one goes through Narconon, while the individual himself
	must pay if he goes directly through the Church of Scientology.
        <p>

	2. By taking the Narconon program, it should be quite obvious that one is automatically
	taking the first steps "up the Bridge" to Scientology, probably even without realizing it.
        <p>

	If a person doesn't take the prescribed steps, he fails the program. A person simply
	cannot seriously undergo this program without becoming a Scientologist, otherwise
	failure is the automatic result. Therefore, in order to become successfully drug free
	under Narconon's treatment, one must become a Scientologist. For these reasons, we
	believe Narconon to be a recruitment tool for the Church of Scientology.
        <p>

	3. Completing, or passing the program or its various steps is also an interesting
	procedure: As it says in paragraph 2 of HCOB 14 Nov 1987..."Each process is run to F/N
	(Floating Needle on the E-meter), cognition (the point at where the patient believes it is
	complete), VGIs (the patient has Very Good Intentions), and Release (says he feels he has
	passed this part of the program)... etc.
        <p>

	In other words, a patient is cured when he thinks he is, and can convince the
	Scientology minister operating the E-meter (if one is being used) that he has good
	intentions. No objective scientific testing is used.
        <p>

	Once a patient attains a state of "release" (thinks he is cured) he must "attest" in order
	to obtain a Certificate of Completion. The patient simply writes down that he has achieved
	the EP (End Phenomena) or promised result of the course. Attesting is simply a method
	used by the Church of Scientology to collect an unlimited number of immediate
	testimonials praising their product, which they then use in their public relations effort.
        <p>

	Much of the Narconon program is common sense, simplistically applied, and if not
	beneficial, at least is not harmful. The balance is an insidious inculcation of the tenents
	of a religion into what is supposed to be a secular "scientific" treatment program for
	addiction, the effectiveness and safety of which has never been established to begin with.
	Narconon does not deserve certification by the state, and at absolute best should be
	allowed to exist and be advertised only as a religious program of the Church of
	Scientology for the spiritual treatment of drug abuse.
