    <h4>1. Milieu Control</h4>


    <p>
      Control of communication within the group environment resulting in a 
      significant degree of isolation from the surrounding society. Includes 
      other techniques to restrict members 1 contact with outside world and 
      to be able to make critical, rational judgments about information: 
      overwork, busy-ness, multiple lengthy meetings, etc. Ufton: "The 
      most basic feature of the thought reform environment, the 
      psychological current upon which all else depends, is the control of 
      human communication. [This includes] not only the individual's 
      communication with the outside..., but also.,.his communication with 
      himself,.. [Thought reform participants may be in doubt as to who is telling what to whom, but the 
      fact that extensive information about everyone is being conveyed to the authorities is always 
      known.] Having experienced the impact of what they consider to be an ultimate truth..., they 
      consider it their duty to create an environment containing no more and no less than this 
      'truth' [The group member] Is deprived of the combination of external Information and Inner 
      reflection which anyone requires to test the realities of his environment and to maintain a measure 
      of identity separate from it..."

      "Phone tree - Each new student will be assigned a Coach (a person of rank yellow or higher). The 
      Coach must not be the person who introduced the student to ESP. Each student will call the Coach, 
      without fail, on a schedule that is to the mutual benefit of the student and the Coach."

      a contact session and Is done at a specified time (can be a time range). This time should be written 
      on the graph. Note: Messages left on answering machines DO NOT COUNT! 
    <p>
      b) Exceptions. If necessary, the time may vary or days may be skipped only if it is arranged and 
      approved by the contact during the previous day's contact session. 
    <p>
      c) Content* During contact session, student relays the progress of the persistence training and their 
      opinions about it, 
    <p>
      Note: This call should not take more than 3 minutes."

      <h4>2. Mystical Manipulation</h4>

    <p>
      The claim of divine authority or spiritual advancement that allows the leader to reinterpret events 
      as he or she wishes, or make prophecies or pronouncements at will, all for the purpose of 
      controlling group members, Lifton: 'The inevitable next step after milieu control is extensive 
      personal manipulation.., Initiated from above, It seeks to provoke specific patterns of behavior and 
      emotion In such a way that these will appear to have arisen spontaneously from within the 
      environment... -Ideological totalists,..are impelled by a special kind of mystique which not only 
      justifies such manipulations, but makes them mandatory,.. They are the agents 'chosen 1 (by 
      history, by God, or by some other supernatural force) to carry out the 'mystical imperative/ the 
      pursuit of which must supersede all considerations of decency or of immediate human welfare, 
      Similarly, any thought or action which questions the higher purpose is considered to be stimulated 
      by a lower purpose, to be backward, selfish, and petty In the face of the great overriding mission,.. 
      At the level of the Individual person, the psychological responses to this manipulative approach 
      revolve about the basic polarity of trust and mistrust. One Is asked to accept these manipulations 
      on a basis of trust (or faith)... When trust gives way to mistrust... the higher purpose cannot serve 
      as adequate emotional sustenance. The individual then responds to the manipulations through 
      developing... the psychology of the pawn. Feeling himself unable to escape from forces more 
      powerful than himself, he subordinates everything to adapting himself to them, He becomes 
      sensitive to all kinds of cues, expert at anticipating environmental pressures, and skillful in riding 
      them in such a way that his psychological energies merge with the tide rather than turn painfully 
      against himself. This requires that he participate actively in the manipulation of others, as well as 
      in the endless round of betraysls and self-betrayals which are required. But whatever his 
      response, „he has been deprived of the opportunity to exercise his capacities for self-expression 
      and independent action." 

    <p>
      [Please see examples under "Sacred Science/ In addition, the idea of the white sash has to not be 
      a suppressive person implies the active manipulation of others - the reporting on others - that they 
      must be loyal to the cause of ESP.] 



      <h4>3. Demand for Purity</h4>

      <p>
      The world is viewed as black and white and group members are constantly exhorted to strive for 
      perfection. Consequently, guilt and shame are common and powerful control devices. Lifton: "In 
      the thought reform milieu, as In all situations of Ideological totalism, the experiential world is 
      sharply divided Into the pure and the impure, into the absolutely good and the absolutely evil. The 
      good and the pure ere of course those Ideas, feelings, and actions which are consistent with the 
      totallst ideology and policy; anything else Is apt to be relegated to the bad and the impure... The 
      philosophical assumption underlying this demand is that absolute purity,. .is attainable... .,.[B]y 
      defining and manipulating the criteria of purity, and then by conducting an all-out war upon 
      impurity, the Ideological totalists create a narrow world of guilt and shame. This Is perpetuated by 
      an ethos of continuous reform, a demand that one strive permanently and painfully for something 
      which not only does not exist but fs In fact alien to the human condition... ...Each person is made 
      vulnerable through his profound inner sensitivities to his own limitations and to his unfulfilled 
      potential... [I.e.,] his existential guilt.,, The individual thus comes to apply the same totalist
      polarization of good and evil to his judgements of his own character... He must also look upon his 
      impurities as originating from outside influences [0]nce an Individual person has experienced 
      the totalist polarization of good and evil, he has great difficulty In regaining a more balanced inner 
      sensitivity to the complexities of human morality..."

      Pennsylvania stated that 93% of all communication is non-verbal. Enthusiastic people are better 
      able to communicate and even sell their Ideas with ease. They are more successful. The ablflty to 
      access and utilize and excited state, at will, is a skill that can greatly simplify the road to success. When you have mastered this module, you will have the magic button."

      necessary to practice finding the switch for several days to develop the ability to use it on 
      demand."

      <h4>4. The Cult of Confession</h4>

      <p>
      Serious (and often not so serious) sins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed, either 
      privately to a personal monitor or publicly to the group at large, Ufton: "Confession is carried 
      beyond its ordinary religious / legal, and therapeutic expressions to the point of becoming a cult in 
      Itseff. There is the demand that one confess to crimes one has not committed, to sinfulness that is 
      artificially induced, in the name of a cure that is arbitrarily imposed. Such demands are made 
      possible not only by the ubiquitous human tendencies toward guilt and shame but also by the need 
      to give expression to these tendencies. In totalist hands, confession becomes a means of 
      exploiting, rather than offering solace for, these vulnerabilities. The assumption underlying total 
      exposure,., is the environment's claim to total ownership of each Individual self within it [TJhe 
      cult of confession makes it virtually impossible to attain a reasonable balance between worth and 
      humility,,,

      1. Blow their cover! - Invitations to project and reveal self: 

      a) What's a person like when they're (x)? 

      b) Who do you know who is (x), describe them.., 

      c) Think of an incident when someone was (x), what were they like? 

      d) Tell me of a time when you (someone) were/was (x)? This also gets more meaning! 

      2. Project out the details! - Getting more data: 

      a) How do you know when they're (x)? 

      b) Imitate someone who is (x).,. 

      c) Teach me how to be (x).,. 

      d) What would you need to be like/have to be to be the projected person? 

      e) How do you think they feel? 

      f) How would you/they feel In the future/past state if you/they were (x)? 

      3. Finding the direct projection! - This question elicits their values, to get it ask yourself, 'Why 
      would they go there now? 1 

      a) Why is that important to you/them? 

      b) What would happen (it be like) If that wasn't/didn't happen? (was no x) 

      c) How would your/their life change if you/they had (x)? 

      d) How would the past have been different if you/they had (x)? 

      4, Get the Inner Deficiency! This question gives you a direct answer to the inner deficiency: 

      a) What do you/they get out of it? 

      b) What would happen if you/they didn't (x)?"

<h4>5. The "Sacred Science" </h4>

<p>
The doctrine of the group is considered the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or disputing. The 
leader of the group is likewise above criticism as the spokesperson is God  on earth. Ufton: The 
totallst milieu contains an aura of sacredness around Its basic dogma, holding It out as an ultimate 
moral vision for the ordering of human existence. This sacredness is evident in the prohibition 
(whether or not explicit) against the questioning of basic assumptions, and In the reverence which 
Is demanded for the originators of the Word, the present bearers of the Word, and the Word Itself. 
While thus transcending ordinary concerns of logic, however, the milieu at the same time makes an 
exaggerated claim of airtight logic, of absolute 'scientific' precision. Thus the ultimate moral vision 
becomes an ultimate science; and the man who dares to criticize it, or to harbor even unspoken 
alternative ideas, becomes not only immoral and Irreverent, but also 'unscientific/ ..The 
assumption here is not so much that man can be God, but that man's ideas can be God.,. At the 
level of the individual, the totallst sacred science can offer much comfort and security. Its appeal 
lies in its seeming unification of the mystical and the logical modes of existence... For within the 
framework of the sacred science, there is room for both careful step-by-step syllogism, and 
seeping, non-rational 'Insights. 1 - [S]o strong a hold can the sacred science achieve over his 
mental processes that If one begins to feel himself attracted to ideas which either contradict or 
ignore it, he may become guilty and afraid, His quest for knowledge is consequently hampered.,."

"Handshaking is a sign of respect and affords us an opportunity to make direct physical contact 
» with others. We believe that many of society's problems have developed because people have 
come to view each other as objects rather than human beings. The handshake is a way to greet 
others in every professional and personal context and is a sign of respect in ESP. Here In ESP, we 
use a two handed handshake. This conveys warmth and a sense of community. Placement of the 
left hand denotes rank. Individuals of higher rank place their left hand on the top. Individuals of 
the same rank shake vertically. Lower rank places the left hand on the bottom. 

<p>
Purpose: To introduce students to the rules and rituals so that they will develop a deep 
appreciation and understanding of ESP.

Crux of the hand is the portion of the hand between the thumb and forefinger, where they form a 
right angle, Wrist cock refers to the angle of the wrist, which can be used to gain control of the 
handshake. It Is Important for control to cock the wrist slightly down as you move into the 
handshake. Positioning of the feet determines dominance. Stepping into the handshake with the 
right foot creates a more dominant position, expressing strength for the hand-shaker, Stepping 
into the handshake with the left foot, will be perceived by both people as a more passive 
expression. The middle and ring fingers are used to gain control of the handshake."

"Student Notes; 
<p>
What is the mission of our school? How does understanding ESP's integrated matrix help us 
determine destructive patterns of human behavior and give us clues as to what is to come? We are 
now at the highest level of technological advancement in human history. The lifestyle current 
technology affords us has never existed before on the planet, Human civilization has had rises and 
falls for centuries; yet It Is our belief humanity cannot survive another fell. All members of the 
human team must understand the historical reasons behind this tendency so we can change it and 
survive, We believe this is the ultimate cause because It means our existence and all other causes 
and our existence depend on this knowledge. The mission of ESP Is to develop an integrated ethical 
framework of human experience to stop the destruction of value in the world and move humanity 
forward. This practice session explains ESP's mission and gives students a clear knowledge of how 
and why we need to act to change historical trends."

<h4>6. Loading the Language</h4>

<p>
The group develops a jargon In many ways unique to itself, often not understandable to outsiders. 
This jargon consists of numerous words and phases which the members understand (or think they 
do), but which really act to dull one's ability to engage in critical thinking. Lifton: The language of 
  the totalist environment is characterized by the thought-terminating cliche. The most far-reaching 
  and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding 
  phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any 
  Ideological analysis... Totalist language, then, Is repetitiously centered on all-encompassing jargon, 
  prematurely abstract, highly categorical, relentlessly judging, and to anyone but its most devoted 
  advocate, deadly dull: in Lionel Trilling's phrase, 'the language of nonthought,'..." 

  "All parasitic strategies lower self-esteem, and therefore, destroy value."

  "Most people (non-Espians) who use parasite patterns are unaware that they are doing something 
  harmful (harmful because it lowers self-esteem)/'

  "Cult - this Is a label that conveys no meaning but devalues the group. It is designed to keep 
  people away from the group without saying what is wrong with it. Example: That's a cult/ 

  Strategy Name: 'Counter culture/ Response; 'What specifically makes the group a cult? 1 Or, r What 
  do you mean by cult?' 'What do they do that's wrong? 1 Key: The dictionary definition Is a system of 
    religious beliefs and rituals/ 1

    "Motivational States: These are the emotional states that move people to become interested and 
    excited enough to take action. There are two directions in which human beings can focus their 
    energy and attention to drive motivation. They focus on and move towards goals or objectives, or 
    they focus on and move away from problems or perceived consequences, 

    Desire State: This is a motivational state that can be accessed at will to drive motivation. It Is a 
    'toward 1 state, - 

    Toward: These patterns focus directly on goals and objectives. When people are utilizing towards 
    patterns, their effort and attention moves them to have, get, obtain and achieve something as a 
    result of desire. 

    Away From: These patterns focus directly on identifying circumstances to avoid, and problems that 
    need solving. People who are utilizing circumstances to avoid, and problems that need solving, 
    People who are utilizing away from patterns focus energy on what should be avoided, gotten rid of 
    or not happen. Threats and fear energize them, 

    Trigger: A stimulus-response mechanism that starts a behavioral pattern Is a trigger. In this 
    context, the trigger Is the internal Image, word or sound; external event or stimulus that happens 
    that causes the emotional state to occur, It Is Important to identify the trigger so that it can be 
    used to bring back the emotional state, in this case, the motivated state at will. 

    Key Elements: This is the exact set of physiological components that make up and trigger the 
    emotional state of a person'

    <h4>7. Doctrine Over Person</h4>

    <p>
    The personal experiences of the group members are subordinated to the "Truth" held by the group- 
    -apparently contrary experiences must be denied or re-interpreted to fit the doctrine of the group. 
    The doctrine is always more important than the individual. Ufton; "This sterile language reflects 
    another characteristic feature of Ideological totallsm: the subordination of human experience to the 
    Claims of doctrine... [W]hen the myth becomes fused with the totalist sacred science, the resulting 
    'logic 1 can be so compelling and coercive that it simply replaces the realities of Individual 
    experience, Consequently, past historical events are retrospectively altered, wholly rewritten, or 
    Ignored, to make them consistent with the doctrinal logic... The same doctrinal primacy prevails in 
    the totalist approach to changing people: the demand that character and Identity be reshaped, not 
    In accordance with one's special nature or potentialities/ but rather to fit the rigid contours of the 
    doctrinal moid... The underlying assumption is that the doctrine-including its mythological 
    elements-is ultimately more valid, True, and real than is any aspect of actual human character or 
    human experience. Thus, even when circumstances require that a totallst movement follow a 
    course of action in conflict with or outside the doctrine, there exists [a need to erect] an elaborate 
    fagade of new rationalizations designed to demonstrate the unerring consistency of the doctrine 
    and the unfailing foresight which it provides... Rather than modify the myth In accordance with 
    experience, the will to orthodoxy requires Instead that men be modified In order to reaffirm the 
    myth... ...The totalist environment... counters. 'deviant' tendencies with the accusation that they 
    stem entirely from personal 'problems'... derived from untoward earlier... influences,, 

    <h4>8. Dispensing of Existence </h4>

    <p>
    The group arrogates to Itself the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. 
    Usually held non-literally, this means that those outside the group are unspiritual, worldly, satanlc, 
    "unconscious," or whatever, and that they must be converted to the ideas of the group or they will 
    be lost. If they refuse to join the group, then they must be rejected by the group members, even If 
    they are family members. In rare cases this concept gives the group the right to terminate the 
    outsider's life. Ufton: "The totalist environment always draws a sharp line between those whose 
    right to existence can be recognized, and those who possess no such right... [0]ne underlying 
    assumption makes this arrogance mandatory: the conviction that there Is just one path to True 
    existence, just one valid mode of being, and that all others are perforce invalid and False... For the 
    individual, the polar emotional conflict is the ultimate existential one of 'being versus nothingness, 1 
    He is likely to be drawn to a conversion experience, which he sees as the only means of attaining a 
    path of existence for the future... The totallst environment., thus stimulates in everyone a fear of 
    extinction or annihilation... A person can overcome this fear and find,-, 'confirmation, 1 not in his 
    individual relationships, but only from the fount of all existence, the totalist Organization. Existence 
    comes to depend upon creed (I believe, therefore I am), upon submission (I obey, therefore I am) 
    and beyond these, upon a sense of total merger with the ideological movement. Ultimately of 
    course one compromises and combines the totalist 'confirmation 1 with Independent elements of 
    personal identity; but one Is ever made aware that, Should he stray too far along this 'erroneous 
    path/ his right to existence may be withdrawn."
