      <h2>Affidavits of Ross v. NXIVM</h2>
      <h4>SECOND AFFIDAVIT OF RICK ROSS</h4>

      <p>
Now comes Rick Ross and after being duly sworn, deposes and says as follows: 
<p>

1 . Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a copy of my Affidavit as filed in NXTVM 
Corporation, et al v. The Ross Institute , No. 03-CV-976 (N.D.N.Y.). I reaffirm all of the 
averments in this Affidavit in their entirety. 
<p>

2. The Complaint in the above action alleges, at paragraph 39., that "Upon 
information and belief, at least one defendant, Rick Ross, has a $4,000,000 judgement [sic] 
against him (annexed [to the Complaint] as Exhibit F) which has not been satisfied and is 
insolvent, thus monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy." 
<p>

3. The allegation that there is a $4,000,000 judgment against me which remains 
unsatisfied is False. As reported in an article published in the Phoenix New Times in December 
1 996, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B, the largest portion of the judgment, 
$3,000,000 in favor of Jason Scott, was settled by the payment by me of $5,000 to Mr. Scott, 
along with my agreement to provide Mr, Scott with 200 hours of my professional services, free 
of charge. 
<p>

4. Plaintiffs and their attorneys could easily have verified the foregoing facts 
through a minimal investigation. A copy of the above-referenced article, along with other 
articles and information concerning the underlying lawsuit, have been posted on the Ross 
Institute website and available for free to the general public for years. I caused the Ross Institute 
to post this adverse information concerning myself because I believe that the public has the right 
to know this information. I also believe that the public has the right to know adverse, 
unflattering and critical information and opinion concerning the plaintiffs and their organization. 

Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury this  September, 2003. 






<h4>AFFIDAVIT OF RICK ROSS</h4>


<p>
Now comes Rick Ross and after being duly sworn, deposes and says as Mows: 
<p>

1 . I reside at 20 River Court Apt. 221 1 Jersey City, New Jersey. I am the 
Executive Director of the Ross Institute, which is located at 1 13 Pavonia Ave. #323 
Jersey City, New Jersey. Both the Ross Institute and I are defendants in the above- 
referenced action. I have personal knowledge of the facts that are set forth herein and I 
submit this affidavit in opposition to the application of plaintiffs NXTVM Corporation, 
formerly known as Executive Success Programs, Ihc, and First Principles, Inc. 
(collectively "ESP") for temporary and preliminary injunctive relief 
<p>

2. I have reviewed the papers submitted by Executive Success Program 
(ESP) now known as NXTVM including the affidavits of Nancy Salzman, Michael Sutton 
and Aaron Kassin.. I have also reviewed the affidavit of defendant Stephanie Franco. The 
statements of Michael Sutton and Aaron Kassin contained misstatements regarding my 
time with them and the puipose of that time. And the statements of Nancy Salzraan 
grossly mischaracterize my work, business concerns and Web site. 
<p>

3. In September of 2002 1 was contacted by the Sutton family, Michael 
Sutton's parents were deeply concerned about their son's involvement with ESP. They 
asked me what I knew about the organization and I said that I had not heard of it. The 
Buttons requested that I research the group and later review with them my impressions of 
the organization and its programs. 
<p>

4. I reviewed the ESP Web site with its program descriptions, philosophy and 
touted "technology." Their training seemed very similar if not identical to other 
controversial groups I have studied, such as EST, Scientology and Landmark Education. 
<p>

5. I met with the Suttons to discuss my impressions. This meeting took place 
in October. We discussed the contents of the ESP Web site; its program descriptions and 
family concerns about Michael Sutton's future considering the growing influence ESP 
exerted his life. The family ultimately decided upon an intervention. 
<p>

I am a consultant and intervention specialist regarding controversial and/or 
potentially unsafe groups, some of which have been called "cults.' 1 This has been the 
focus of my work for twenty years. Such interventions are an educational process, not 
therapy or counseling. It involves a professional presentation and dialog about a particular 
group and/or leader, This often includes a detailed discussion about the group's methods 
of recruitment, indoctrination, persuasion and retention techniques, The focus of such an 
intervention is to inform the subject This effort not only includes the person involved in a 
group, but also their family and often others who are concerned. The puipose of such an 
intervention is to hopefully stimulate critical thinking and ultimately help the subject 
  they had about their son's involvement with ESP. The Sutton's had no interest in ESP 
  "protected materials," only the undue influence and subsequent control that Nancy 
  Saizman, Keith Raniere and ESP exercised over their son's life. 
<p>

  10. During the intervention Nancy Saltan called Michael Sutton. One day I 
  sat next to him as they conversed. Ms, Salzman suggested that it would be a good idea for 
  ESP to be evaluated by well recognized "cult experts" and Michael Sutton subsequently 
  requested me to provide a list of the "top ten" such experts I would suggest. I provided 
  him with a list which included John Hochman, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist, and Paul 
  Martin, Ph.D. ? a clinical psychologist 
<p>

  11 . When we parted in Florida Michael Sutton seemed interested in further 
  discussion and investigation regarding the issues we discussed concerning ESP. We met 
  again in New York and New Jersey for further discussions during December at his family 
  home and at his office. 
<p>

  12. Stephanie Franco joined one meeting at the Sutton family home, She came 
  to explain to Mi chael her own concerns about ESP, why she left the group and her fears 
  for others still involved. At some point during this meeting, she advised us that she had a 
    workbook or study guide from ESP. She later loaned this workbook to her brother 
    Jeffrey. Jeffrey Sutton later sent me copies of the workbook, 
<p>

    13. The Sutton's were also very worried about their daughter Leslie and her 
    husband Aaron Kassin, who were also involved with ESP.. They asked if I would come to 
    their home again and accompany them to Aaron and Leslie's home for another family 
    discussion. Aaron had been recruited by Michael Sutton to attend ESP programs and the 
    Sutton family felt the programs had had a negative and disturbing effect upon him as 
    well. 
<p>

    14. On or about December 28, 2002, 1 met with the Suttons and we walked 
    over to the Kassin residence, which is quite close to the Sutton home in Elderon, New 
    Jersey* Neither the Sutton's nor I had any interest in Aaron giving us "protected 
    information" about ESP* We only wanted to discuss the Suttons' concerns about how ESP 
    had affected his life and their son Michael, The only attempt to "elicit information from 
    [Aaron]" was requesting he respond to family concerns and frankly discuss what we had 
    learned about ESP and Keith Raniere. 
<p>

    15 . During this discussion I may have mentioned that I had reviewed ESP 
    material, such as the- organization's website, and the study guide I received from 
    Stephanie, but I never asked Aaron to "provide [me] with confidential materials/' 
    <p>

    16. Until the filing of this lawsuit, neither Stephanie Franco nor anyone else 
    ever mentioned the existence of any confidentiality agreement to me and I was not aware 
    of any confidentiality agreement I never received any information suggesting that ESP 
    considered its workbook or other materials to be "trade secrets* until after this lawsuit 
    was filed. In fact, as noted above, the substance of the ESP materials seemed to be 
    similar if not identical to materials I have reviewed in connection with my study of other 
    groups. After this lawsuit was filed I was informed that ESP alleged Stephanie Franco 
    had somehow violated "confidentiality" regarding ESP and its property, and that it 
    considered at least some of its materials to be trade secrets. 
    <p>

    17. I never advised Aaron that I "intended to publish the ESP materials on 
    [my] website." And we certainly didtrt discuss confidentiality, trademark, copyright or 
    trade secret issues. We spent our time discussing femily concerns regarding Aaron's 
    welfare. 
    <p>

    18. The Sutton family sought further expert opinion. They retained John 
    Hochman and Paul Martin to review ESP's programs, as described-in ESFs website and 
    study guide, Michael agreed that after these reports were completed there would be 
    another meeting during which Michael would discuss -the reports with the doctors, These 
    meetings were planned to take place by phone or in person at Michael's office in 
    Manhattan. However, Michael Sutton did not follow through and never met with the 
    doctors. There were no further meetings or discussion and the case was closed. 
    <p>

    19, Some months later, due to my continued concern about ESP and its 
    potential to harm other families, I decided to create an archive page about the group and 
    Keith Raniere within the Ross Institute database. 
    <p>

    20. The Ross Institute (TRI) is a nonprofit, tax-exempt organization devoted 
    to public education and research. TRTs mission is to study cults, destructive cults, 
    controversial groups and movements and to provide information easily accessible to the 
    public through the Internet for educational purposes, TRTs database includes news 
    stories, research papers, reports, court documents, book excerpts, personal testimonies 
    and hundreds of links to additional relevant resources, TRI provides free, public access 
    to its database through its Internet websites, www.rickross.com and www.cultnews.com . 
    <p>

    21. The ESP archive page represents a very small fraction of TRTs database, 
    with only a few articles and reports, as well as a link to ESP's website. The TRI database 
    includes more than 250 archive pages and most are larger than the ESP/NXIVM page, 

    <p>
    22. There is a disclaimer posted and/or linked prominently throughout the TRI 
    Web site and on the ESP page specifically that states: 
    The information within the Ross Institute archives has been collected to offer 
    the public a resource concerning groups called "cults," controversial 
    organizations and movements. 

    <p>
    However* the mention and/or inclusion of a group or leader within 
    this archive does not define that group as a "cult" and/or an 
    individual mentioned as either destructive and/or harmful. Instead, 
    such inclusion simply reflects that archived articles and/or research is 
    available about a group or person that has generated some interest 
    and/or controversy. 

    <blockquote>
    <p>
    All the information archived most be evaluated critically, through a 
    process of independent and individual judgment Please note that 
    there are links often prominently posted at the top of each individual 
    page to a group or movements own official website, which reflect 
    their views. It is important to see what they have to say.

    this archive may request that it be removed and/or that future 
    material be excluded. An official written request made by the 
    copyright holder and/or their legal representative will be honored/ 1 
  </blockquote>
    <p>

    23 . The ESP archive page includes links to articles referencing the plaintiffs, 
    Keith Raniere* and a prior business venture of Mr. Raniere 3 as well as the previously 
    mentioned reports by doctors John Hochman and Paul Martin, copies of which are 
    attached to this Affidavit as Exhibits A, B and C, All of the reports include quotations 
    and references to various ESP materials, including materials from ESP's website and the 
    workbook, Both of these well respected and widely recognized experts made their 
    reports available through TRTs website in the public interest Neither I, nor TRI, nor the 
    doctors, received any "commercial benefit" through making these reports publicly 
    available through TRI's database. None of us are in competition with ESP, 
    <p>

    24. In recent news stories, such as the Albany Times-Union or MSNBC, I 
    have responded factually about complaints received about ESP/NXTVM from families 
    and former participants called "Espians," I have also expressed genuine concern about 
    the potential risk these programs seem to pose. One complaint I received involved a 
    participant having a "breakdown" that required hospitalization. I understand that the 
    Keith Raniere, Nancy Salzman and their associates may not appreciate public discussion 
    and/or criticism about their business practices. But I believe that 1 have the right and 
    responsibility to express my opinions and report concerns about their programs.
